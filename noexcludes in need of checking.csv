"15","3003427","English","COTCH, ALANNA K.","_Ê_Being among the pioneers_Êù: Rhetorics of activism in the narratives of nineteenth-century American women writers","University of New Mexico-Main Campus","Ph.D.",2001,228,"Catharine Maria Sedgwick's <italic>Hope Leslie</italic> (1827), Harriet Jacobs' <italic>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</italic> (1861), Louisa May Alcott's Work: <italic>A Story of Experience</italic> (1873), and Frances E. W. Harper's <italic>Iola Leroy</italic> (1892) all contain politically active female protagonists who challenge and embrace the political culture of nineteenth-century America. These protagonists function as models of activism for nineteenth-century female audiences, revealing the ways in which readers may become politically active agents of change. Placing these texts in the context of nineteenth-century rhetorical tradition reveals the ways in which they engage in a civic-minded, neoclassical rhetorical practice that was popular in the early part of the century. Sedgwick, Jacobs, Alcott, and Harper each creates in her protagonist a literary incarnation of the neoclassical rhetorical ideal, the _Ê_good man speaking well_Êù who persuades his audience to act for the good of the nation. These authors both adhere to and transform this male model by giving their female protagonists opportunities to speak publicly and to persuade their audiences about issues the authors saw as vital to the future of the nation. Hope Leslie, Linda Brent, Christie Devon, and Iola Leroy thus establish themselves as voices of dissent, calling attention to the ills of a nation, and as voices of reform, encouraging readers to act against injustice and to strengthen their country. These texts, therefore, function as sites of public discourse and political activism. ^ Together these texts form a trajectory that reveals nineteenth-century American women writers' increasing willingness (or ability) to imagine rhetorically powerful women who are integrated into their political landscapes. This trajectory parallels the progress that white women and African Americans made as they gained more public visibility and demanded more rights. Together, these novels demonstrate that women writers in the nineteenth century, like their colleagues in the women's rights, abolitionist, and temperance movements, had much to contribute to political discourse. Reevaluation of these texts, therefore, can also help us reevaluate the contributions that women made to both the political and rhetorical climate of nineteenth-century America. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Historical / Archival|Rhetorical Analysis ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Women's Studies|Literature, American|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Frances E.

To evaluate these strategies the three treatments were implemented in 23 public speaking classrooms at three post-secondary educational institutions. The students in the classes were given a questionnaire composed of dichotomous, scale, and open-ended questions following the final examination. The results were compared to a control group. A total of 342 usable questionnaires were returned. In addition to the questionnaires, focus group interviews were conducted to enrich the data collected. ^ The findings of the research project suggest that institutional type (public four-year, religious four-year, and public two-year) had no impact on self-reported instances of cheating. The study also revealed that there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of treatment types based on institutional types. Finally, the study revealed a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of cheating prevention strategies. While none of the strategies were statistically significantly different from the control group, a statistically significant difference was found between the one of the treatment groups (threats of punitive measures) and the other two groups (pro-public speaking rhetoric, increasing students' awareness of cheating).

There have always been and will continue to be arguments for monolinguistic literacy practices. These practices, however, create artificial distinctions between language practices that are _Ê_good_Êù and those that are _Ê_bad_Êù; and monolinguistic literacy practices are often aligned with an agonistic narrative of progress in which new texts _Ê_master_Êù the work of past texts and individuals. In arguing against monolinguistic literacy practices, I do so because I have discursive inheritances and debts to others I must acknowledge and struggle with. To this end, I argue for and enact a literacy theory and practice that is dialogic, reflective, and recursive, that listens to past texts, while critically responding to or reading these texts in relation to subjective experiences and other texts. Throughout this dissertation, moreover, I emphasize the creation of agency by returning to three key terms: <italic>beginnings, memories</italic>, and <italic>participation </italic>.

This dissertation reconstructs Isocrates' conception of the forms of rhetorical discourse. The first chapter of the dissertation reviews scholarly attempts to classify the Isocratean discourses. It is demonstrated that, from the time of Isocrates' career to the present era, theorists have misrepresented his discourses by forcing them into interpretive molds with which they are not compatible. This is symptomatic of widespread misunderstanding of Isocratean rhetorical theory. The second chapter describes Isocrates' complex and interesting conception of rhetorical action. Isocrates' theory of rhetorical composition aimed at the achievement of specified goals. The major goal of the second chapter is to compile and define the goals which Isocrates specified as being legitimate purposes of discourse, including ê_ê¢ _Ê_offering general advice,_Êù _Ê_admonishment,_Êù _Ê_dissuasion,_Êù _Ê_exhortation,_Êù _Ê_requesting,_Êù _Ê_censure,_Êù _Ê_accusation,_Êù _Ê_defense,_Êù _Ê_praise,_Êù _Ê_lamentation,_Êù _Ê_introduction,_Êù _Ê_exposition,_Êù and _Ê_display._Êù In the third chapter a number of prose forms mentioned or used by Isocrates are described. Isocrates knew of a large number of prose forms, including speeches appropriate for deliver in courts of law and deliberative assemblies, letters, panegyrics, encomia, paraineseis, and essays. The structures of these vehicles are in many places specified by Isocrates; in others places they can be inferred from his practice. In the fourth chapter each of the thirty Isocratean discourses is described as a conventional form which aims at the achievement of a particular purpose or purposes. The dissertation concludes with an appendix in which the various meanings of the Isocratean term for _Ê_form,_Êù <italic>idea</italic> or <italic>eidos,</italic> are specified. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Rhetorical Analysis|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","close reading of one theorist",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Discourse|Greek|Isocrates|Rhetorical","Director","Robert N.

The first section analyzes technical writing texts published in the 1990s and nursing texts published between 1986 and 1999 to determine the applicability of their guidance to the writing done by CRAs. The survey of several well-known technical writing texts provides an overall idea of the major tenets of these texts and their evolution from earlier ones. Nursing texts are included because many CRAs have nursing backgrounds; these texts are examined to discover if writing (outside of charting) is taught in the nursing curriculum. Nursing texts are also analyzed to discover the approach used to teach writing to nursing students. ^ The second segment examines the CRO, discusses the drug-approval process, and provides information on the costs and time associated with the drug-approval process. Included is a description of BetterDrug, Inc., a fictionalized, yet representative, composite of the various CROs used in this research. Also described is Nancy Monitor, a fictional CRA who works at BetterDrug Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Nancy is a composite of the CRAs interviewed for this project, but is not meant to represent any one CRA. As an illustrative writer, Nancy Monitor allows us to better understand the CRA's writing strategies and her role within the CRO. Creating the fictional BetterDrug, Inc., allows Nancy's documents to be placed within a particular context and within a particular organizational culture. ^ The third major section discusses three typical representative CRO documents: the phone contact report, the query, and follow-up letter. In this part, the documents are first presented as they are <italic>typically</italic> written (based on the documents analyzed and used for this dissertation) by CRAs. Then, the rhetorical concepts of Aristotle, Burke, and Rogers are applied to determine if the application of these rhetorical strategies might enhance the documents by making them more user-friendly and accessible, while promoting the writer's ethos. ^ Finally, recommendations are made for universities and for CROs that wish to better train their CRAs to meet the multiple and varied writing tasks they face. Specific modules to be included in a semester-long course are outlined. The proposed modules are based on the research I have conducted within CROs since 1995, and are intended to be used in universities that are developing more industry-specific writing courses and are relying less on the general technical writing course. ^","Ethnographic ~check|Poetic / Fictive|Rhetorical Analysis ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,1,3,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Contract research organizations|Clinical research associates|Writing|Research associates","Director","Steven Lynn",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, I offer an analysis of the shifts within the social and political landscape of the culture and shifts within the liberal arts curriculum of turn-of-the-century American universities, the institutionalization of which dramatically altered the nature and purpose of higher education. Specifically, I undertake to examine the rise of literary studies and the simultaneous displacement of classical rhetorical training. I argue that to understand the institutionalization of Literature, scholars must address the advance of capitalism <italic>and</italic> the impact of mass immigration, quasi-scientific discourses such as evolution, efficiency and eugenics, and the nation's commitment to racial segregation. These events induced dramatic reconceptualizations of liberal political philosophy, national identity, citizenship, and race_Êîall of which affected educational thought and practice. Thus, as the concept of citizenship changed from a learned activity to an innate capacity determined by one's racial inheritance, university curricula shifted from civic to literary education. ^ Second, I attempt to theorize, in light of the raced history of the institutionalization of English, the important and necessary use of the democratic imperative to expand individual and collective capacities to self-govern as an ethical referent for what we in English departments do. Specifically, I draw on critical traditions in cultural studies and classical rhetoric that engage the questions of culture, individual and collective agency, and substantive democracy. Working in the intersection of these fields, I focus on the contributions two figures who took part in reform movements that emerged largely outside the university yet managed to bridge the concerns of students with those of ordinary citizens. The first was the adult education movement in Britain largely associated with the work of Raymond Williams, which became one of the seminal influences in shaping contemporary cultural studies. I also draw from the work of Cornelius Castoriadis, whose writing had a profound impact on the French student-worker movement of 1968. This analysis, I argue, is necessary to defend the university as one of the last public spheres for dialogue and debate so essential to the ongoing political education of citizens and the revitalization of democracy itself. ^","Historical / Archival|Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check|Philosophical / Theoretical|Cultural-Critical Studies","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Literature, General|Education, History of|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Race|Citizenship|English|Institutionalization","Adviser","Evan Watkins",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It begins with a literature-based, critical investigation into the reported reluctance of technical editors to adopt electronic editing procedures. The theory advanced is that for many editors the greater responsiveness and tangibility of hard-copy editing creates inherent advantages over on-screen editing which they are unwilling to give up for potential gains in efficiency. ^ Preliminary qualitative research and a pilot survey produced substantial evidence that most technical communicators did indeed associate hard-copy editing with ergonomic, portability, and text-processing advantages. Most of those contacted, however, also valued the potential gains in efficiency of editing on screen. While a good number of them chose hard-copy markup over on-screen markup options, most reported frequently or primarily editing on screen. ^ A more in-depth study involving 20 face-to-face interviews with technical communicators at five different workplaces showed that organizational cultures mediate perceptions of electronic editing according to their unique configuration of priorities and established practices. Finally, a sample survey of 992 members of the Society for Technical Communication provided a global snapshot of editing practices in technical communication. In 1998, technical communicators who edited others were about evenly divided between those who used hard-copy markup alone as their primary editing method and those who used one form or another of keyboarding changes and annotations directly into computer files. Most technical communicators who edited others used both hard copy and electronic editing procedures, alternately or together. About two-thirds at least occasionally used some form of electronic procedures when editing others, and most of those used hard copy to mark up or to proofread as part of their standard electronic editing process. ^ The erratic diffusion of electronic editing in technical communication is explained from a theoretical perspective that combines the Diffusion of Innovations theory and the explanatory conceptual framework of cultural-historical activity theory. Predictions about the future evolution of electronic editing practices are offered, along with recommendations for future research into technical editing and, more generally, the adoption and diffusion process by which new technologies affect the lifeworlds of practitioners. ^","Survey|Interview / Focus Group|Model-Building ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Electronic editing|Innovation diffusion|Technical communication","Chairperson","Carolyn R.

Further research on the effects of peer revision on L2 writing is still needed in order to justify its continued use in the ESL classroom. This study sought to investigate single sex and mixed peer revision on English as a Second Language writing of Puerto Rican college students. Four questions were guided this investigation. ^ This study followed a descriptive design. Methodological triangulation or a multiple data collection strategy was applied. A qualitative and quantitative research approach was used to analyze the data. The participants were twenty advanced ESL college students enrolled in a writing course. The interaction between pairs of students as it occurred during two revision sessions was recorded and transcribed. An analysis of results based on the transcripts, the students' first drafts, revision sheets, and final drafts revealed an extremely complex and productive interactive process among the dyads studied. Five different mediating strategies were identified: employing symbols and external resources, using the L1, providing scaffolding, resorting to interlanguage knowledge and vocalizing private speech. Results revealed that female and mixed dyads showed more management of authorial control, collaboration, affectivity, and adopting reader/writer roles than male dyads. Only one male dyad carried out a collaborative interaction. ^ The language device of interruptions was used to analyze the extent that gender arrangements by sex pairs (same vs. mixed) in mediated assistance affected the development of the written texts. Findings showed that female and mixed dyads worked better and incorporated more revisions in their final versions. In the Puerto Rican context, male-male combination was not an effective mix in the revision process. Findings of this study have pedagogical implications for the English curriculum in Puerto Rico. Teachers should consider peer revision as a useful language learning experience. The study's findings suggest ESL/EFL teachers to adopt instructional methods and provide a social environment that accommodates a variety of styles for both females and males. ^","Experimental ~check|Practitioner / Teacher Research|Discourse or Text Analysis|Clinical / Case Study","",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,0,0,2,"Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","English as a second language|College students|Puerto Rican|Writing|Peer revision","Chairperson","Maria A.

Even those who went beyond the term _Ê_family values_Êù very often talked more about family structure than actual _Ê_values._Êù That fact often left the impression that the structure of the family would somehow bring about _Ê_family values,_Êù whatever they felt that latter term to mean. ^ Although there were many who sincerely wanted to help families, many of those US politicians and social activists rendered the perception they had a personal or political agenda to vaunt and were using the term _Ê_family values_Êù to capture the attention of the US public. ^ This work examined the term _Ê_family values_Êù through the research of a social historian to try to determine what those rhetoricians meant. The finding was there was no definition that was quantifiable, universal (for all US families), and time-resistant for _Ê_family values._Êù I am not saying values did not exist in families during 1950_Ê_2000 in the United States. What I am saying is that the term _Ê_family values_Êù was not a definable concept, and as a result families were trying to cope with a specific concept that did not exist. ^ I made this determination after researching the exact words of US politicians and social activists between 1950_Ê_2000 through their autobiographies, and Mission Statements on their websites. These two primary sources were used to obtain their exact words and the context in which they spoke. ^ The purpose of this work was to lessen pressures on families that rhetoricians seemed to be imposing on them by stating they were not living up to certain _Ê_family values,_Êù a term, as stated above, that is not definable. This PDE achieved its purpose of lessening pressures on US families by proving that _Ê_family values_Êù did not exist in universal or time-resistant terms and therefore only individuals or, in some cases the family as a unit, determined what was best for their family, however they chose to define family. ^","Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"History, United States|History, Modern|Sociology, Individual and Family Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Family values|Rhetoric|Social activists|Politicians","Adviser","Marvin B.

In particular, it examines which rhetorical strategies students in an upper-level engineering course rely on to complete writing assignments.

Through various methods of data collection, I examine what students learned in that course and whether or not they rely on that knowledge as they complete writing assignments in an engineering class. I also discover the other academic and workplace experiences that have shaped students' rhetorical knowledge. I examine processes employed by students to produce written products, investigate the ways in which students' learned these processes, and identify the ways in which students articulate rhetorical concepts. ^ This study is important because we know very little about how the content we teach students in technical communication courses is being transferred, or whether it is transferred at all. Only a few researchers have examined the ways in which rhetorical skills and strategies are transferred from one course to another. These studies devoted to learning transfer indicate that often students are unable to make connections between different courses or different contexts, even when those situations require similar rhetorical strategies. ^ This study is timely because engineering as a discipline is currently engaged with issues of how to prepare students for the communicative demands of the profession, in part because of accreditation concerns raised by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).

Composing in online realms involves sculpting and communicating multiple identities, displaying various subjectivities, and asserting complex agency through complicated collages of text, graphics, and other media. Moreover, new media and new realms provide for new social and rhetorical positionings for individuals composing within these spaces. Composition scholarship, however, has paid little situated attention to the articulations of identity, subjectivity, and agency in online spaces from within a larger postmodern context. By reading, analyzing, and understanding both the promises and the perils of online identity projects, we can form larger conclusions about the worlds_Êîboth virtual and physical_Êîwe inhabit. ^ Although many composition teachers recognize that the meaning of <italic> composition</italic> shifts in different realms, many of us have yet to transform our pedagogical approaches and theories in ways that help students explore, develop, represent, and communicate more effectively within online realms. We cannot succeed at this task, however, unless we, ourselves, gain some familiarity with the structures, histories, demands, practices, implications, and micropolitical action of and within new communication spaces, as well as the ways in which they reflect the complex and rapidly shifting social, rhetorical, and cultural conditions with which we all cope. ^ If we develop more critical, situated approaches to understanding the complications of online space, both we and the students in our classrooms can work toward an understanding of this space that recognizes its complex fabric, its cultural reproductions, and its progressive ruptures. In this dissertation, I borrow from feminist theory broadly, feminist theory of technology studies specifically, postmodern theory, and composition studies to scaffolded snapshots of various articulations of women's identity, agency, and subjectivity in online realms. These snapshots include focused attention to bulletin board systems and how women come to technology in these realms; representations of so-called cyborgs and how women rupture conventional stylings of cyborg identity; and women's self-sponsored and self-published pornography sites and how these sites blur our notions of the public-private divide. ^ In the conclusion of this dissertation, I discuss how the creative online work of these women help us to work toward understandings that will allow us to revise composition curricula to better appreciate virtual realms and students' representations within them. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Mass Communications","Situated actions|Feminism|Emerging identities|Internet|Computers|Women","Adviser","Cynthia L.

Data is gathered in multiple ways and from multiple sources, including a personal background information questionnaire, a series of intensive interviews on their process of composing a research paper for a course, a retrospective paper on their process of composing the paper, an essay on their personal writing history, observations, and documents_Êîe.g., drafts and the final paper with the professor's comments and grade, the syllabus, and relevant course handouts and emails. ^ Composing research papers is found to be a main part of the discovering, critical-thinking, and learning in the participants' graduate studies. Overall, the findings are consistent with the social cognitive view that composing involves complex multifaceted cognitive and social/cultural knowledge and strategies of meaning construction in a situated discourse context. The participants' composing was influenced by four contextual factors in particular: the writer, the professor, the language, and the source texts. Their composing processes had an overall progression that involved three main stages_Êîprewriting, text-writing, and revising-editing_Êîwhich were linear in an overall sense but which recurred in a spiraling way, as the participants gradually progressed from a general focus at the start to a specific focus at the end, when their final written texts were finished. The most time and effort was spent on the prewriting stage, especially on reading source texts and on constructing a theoretical framework for their papers.

In Calvino's thesis, still unpublished, it is interesting to see how many aspects he has in common with Conrad, a style marked by visual writing, binary-voice, binary point of view, and the attempt to combine autobiography and fiction through an oral and fabled narration. ^ The second chapter is a theoretical interpretation of the _Ê_Gaze of Perseus._Êù It identifies the reasons Calvino employed this narrative style, through which he transformed the novel and text into Hyper-novel (= iper-romanzo) and Hypertext (= romanzo-rete). ^ The CD-ROM is part of the third chapter and shows the narrative innovations of <italic>Le citte invisibili</italic>, which was defined by Calvino as an _Ê_iper-romanzo_Êù (= hyper-novel) and _Ê_romanzo-rete_Êù (= novel as net).

Composition scholars have failed to articulate critical theoretical differences among reflective activities, which serves to construct these activities as interchangeable, as equally beneficial, and as theoretically compatible. While <italic>reflection</italic> has become a catch-all term for the infinite ways students can write about their own writing, the various conceptualizations of reflection are limited almost exclusively to post-draft, retrospective activities designed to facilitate the transaction and assessment of a target draft or a set of target texts. ^ In this dissertation, I argue that current notions of student reflection are based on instructors' needs for gathering data about their students and about the texts on which students are reflecting. I construct critical inquiries into the performative aspects of reflective writing and into the metaphorical discourse surrounding the topic of reflection (e.g. student reflection as a mirror, window, or a portrait of the writer). ^ In order to reconceptualize composition's notion of student reflection to be more consistent with theories of reflective thinking espoused by John Dewey, Lev Vygotsky, Michael Polanyi, and Donald Schon, I propose a new model of reflection centered around Schon's notion of reflection-in action. In my model, students use reflective activities to reframe indeterminate moments during their drafting processes into problem/solution situations. These in-draft reflective activities guide in class reflective conversations with other practitioners and the instructor at various levels of removal from the original drafting activity and, in turn, also help to shape students' writing in post-draft reflective activities. ^ By offering a multifaceted critique of current notions of reflection and by outlining a detailed, theoretically grounded model for reconceiving student reflection, this dissertation lays the groundwork for a fundamental shift toward using reflection as a way for students to learn about their own writing and for future research in student reflection. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Practitioner / Teacher Research ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Writing instruction|Composition|Student reflection","Adviser","Brian Huot",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study advances three theoretical premises of model construction, a structural premise maintaining that narratives are grounded in concrete spatial structure, a functional premise describing how these two structures interact at complex levels, and a procedural premise positing model-building operations. ^ To investigate the theory, twenty undergraduates were asked to read a short passage on love by the Italian writer Boccaccio and respond to five reading and writing tasks. In all the passages, the general narrative was held constant while the spatial dynamics of love were adjusted (e.g., love is a Reception, Attraction, Absorption, or Penetration). The results reveal that all the readers instantiated the generic, spatial systems yet differed in their ability to fill in critical missing inferences about the main character's psychological motives. Better readers were more skilled at accessing the organizing principles inherent in knowledge and using these structures to generate and configure models of psychological experience. ^ The final chapter investigates whether it is possible to teach undergraduates how to improve their model-building skills.

Through the investigation of three case studies, all falling into the first decade of television's entry into political culture, it reveals the power of two primary narratives. The first narrative holds television as a medium for the exemplary practice of democracy. This narrative imagines that television's positive impact on American life is attained through the dissemination of information to nearly every voter. Information dissemination is thought to produce an informed and educated electorate unavailable before television, and as a result, to produce an improved form of American democracy. The second narrative holds television as a technological invader on traditional cultural and political life. Its spectacular image, magnificent capacities, and dramatic stories, combined with the technologically aided collapse of time and space is thought to produce a negative impact on politics by entertaining and distracting viewers, rather than engaging them in a deliberative form of democracy. I argue that these two narratives polarize discussions of political television and ultimately diminish the imagined capacities of Americans to practice citizenship in the age of electronic media. This form of rhetoric about technology is germane not only to television, but, increasingly, to concerns about the viability of the Internet as a means of communication between governments and publics. ^","Historical / Archival|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"American Studies|Political Science, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Mass Communications","Politics|Audience|Television|Technological medium","Director","Bonnie J.

The rhetoric manuals studied_ÊîThomas Wilson's <italic>The Arte of Rhetorique </italic>, Henry Peacham's <italic>The Garden of Eloquence</italic>, and Angel Day's <italic>The English Secretorie</italic>_Êîare viewed as palimpsests, layers of appropriated classical rhetorical theory overlaid with contemporary insights, theory, and exempla imbued with cosmological attributes characteristic of the Great Chain of Being. Wilson's manual promoted unity in the English language while simultaneously stressing the need for variety in rhetoric in order to adapt to the varying societal levels of his hierarchical culture. Peacham sought to use the <italic>copia</italic> of rhetoric as a means to describe the <italic>copia</italic> of his world and reinforce its divinely ordained order. Day saw rhetoric as a tool primarily of praise for both lifting people up and closer to God as well as a means for keeping them in their appropriate God-given station assigned at birth. ^ As the manuals integrated classical rhetorical theory with contemporary ideas influenced heavily by cosmology, they also had to contend with paradoxes in that same cosmology, in particular, the impulse to assimilate with God, achieving a oneness or unity with Him, and the impulse to celebrate and maintain the existing plenitude of God's divine hierarchy. These two contradictory and paradoxical impulses existed in tenuous proximity to each other only because theorists of the time kept them from being articulated together simultaneously through strategic evasion or judicious inattention according to Arthur O. Lovejoy. The melding of Sixteenth Century cosmological ideas on to particular classical, rhetorical tenets risked bringing the two paradoxical impulses together in a classical rhetorical taxonomy not designed to keep the two impulses in avoidance of each other. The result in the <italic>Arte of Rhetorique</italic> was an unusual amending of the classical theory of the three styles. In the <italic> English Secretorie</italic>, the result was an awkward and direct statement of the cosmological paradox within Day's rhetorical theory.

Exploring the collaborative relationship between Goldman and Forrest over the last year of Forrest's life, the study develops a theory of adaptation as a confluence of artistic, literary, critical, ethnographic, ethical, political, and pedagogical energies. It argues that Forrest's novel contains and embodies its own emergent theory of adaptation. ^ Part One of the study explores Leon Forrest's life and the significance of his work, and offers a critical and historical examination of the much-practiced but undertheorized area of adaptation within the discipline of performance studies. The techniques of _Ê_chamber theatre_Êù outlined by Robert Breen are considered in relation to a range of cultural and literary theorists.

He maintains a generally positive view of classical rhetoric, while at the same time emptying it of worth in obtaining the ends of Christian oratory. One of the most important transformations Augustine makes to classical rhetoric is found in the canon of invention. His adaptation centers upon the ontological and epistemological presuppositions that are inherent in rhetorical invention. A rhetorical epistemology refers to the nature and limit of knowledge, how knowledge is obtained and to what extent that knowledge can be shared with others through language. As the basis of deriving knowledge, invention is where epistemological theory meets rhetorical practice. A rhetorical ontology refers to assumptions of what would have to exist for the rhetor's theory to be true. ^ Augustine receives the tradition of rhetorical invention from Gorgias, Plato, and Cicero. Each rhetorical theorist requires their respective orator to have knowledge, but the nature and extent of knowledge vary according to the epistemological assumptions. Augustine suggests that the ideal orator should have broad knowledge, but this knowledge is neither necessary nor sufficient for the Christian orator whose knowledge derives ultimately from the Word made flesh, and the word of God. Invention for Augustine becomes a dynamic encounter with the W/word of God. ^ The rhetorical ontology of each theorist reveals assumptions about the descriptive nature of language. Three _Ê_ontological gaps_Êù are detailed and how each theorist bridges these _Ê_gaps_Êù reveals their authority of language. The authority of language is what justifies the orator's use of language. Augustine views the authority of language as the Word made flesh. The incarnation of Christ as the spoken Word of God becomes for Augustine the source and goal of all rhetorical encounters, which changes the consequential nature of language. The aim of persuasion becomes the aim of clarity by which Christ, the Internal Teacher, instructs the auditor and creates a community that exemplifies the twin loves of God and neighbor. In Augustine, the rhetorical tradition finds its sharpest critic and most able defender, and through rhetoric Augustine finds a useful tool to enjoy God. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Religion, Philosophy of|Philosophy|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Gorgias|Saint Augustine|Ontology|Cicero|Rhetoric|Invention|Epistemology|Plato","Supervisor","Nancy Wood",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, I re-consider the view of faculty in previous WAC research, the categorization of genres as a means of determining what is occurring in classrooms, faculty perspectives on what they are preparing students for, and the value of lore as a means of developing a narrative understanding of pedagogy. I also reflect on my own process of making meaning of the data I collected, which was primarily informant self-report, collected through surveys, audiotape and field notes. ^ The research was comprised of three stages: a survey of the entire faculty, a series of group interviews with twelve faculty members, and individual interviews with three faculty members who had attended the group interviews. The survey, comprised of four open-ended questions, elicited the faculty's view of writing within their discipline, what assignments they used in courses for their majors, what they wanted students to learn from these courses and how they felt writing assisted students in learning. The group and individual interviews allowed the teachers to expound on their understanding of writing and learning within their disciplines, to explain the nuances of their assignments, and, in the case of the group interviews, to discuss their similarities and differences. ^ My narrative of their narratives reiterates the fact that each discipline, even each faculty member, defines and uses assignments differently: _Ê_journals_Êù and _Ê_essay exams_Êù take on several very different shapes in the classrooms of my informants. My narrative questions the usefulness of categories by problematizing James Moffet's broad categories of discourse, which I at first believed corresponded to what I was seeing in my data. It also notes that these faculty members are concerned with preparing students for a broader, perhaps uncertain, future as well as introducing the constraints of the discipline, and that their expectations shape their assigning and evaluating of writing. It ponders how or whether their expectations create a theorized pedagogy. ^ Finally, it focuses on the conversations that occurred, via discourse analysis, developing the hypothesis that when lore rooted in current composition theory meets the writing lore of faculty in other disciplines, there are a few possible results: the instructors are so grounded in the lore they bring with them that no deliberation or contemplation of change occurs, the lores _Ê_match_Êù and one or the other is assimilated into the other, or one lore is discarded in light of the evidence in support of the other.

The critical theory that grounds this research includes Erving Goffman's concept of a _Ê_primary framework._Êù The importance of this analysis lies in the recognition of the scientific narrative and how its construction of _Ê_objectivity_Êù naturalizes its representations. My analysis relies on Michel Foucault and Jean-Franê_ois Lyotard's observations of the scientific metanarrative that structures the contemporary representation of knowledge. The major argument of this study identifies the epistemological and political influences on the representation in the documentary frame, and examines how the scientific metanarrative is at cross-purposes with politically progressive documentaries. One goal of this research is to evacuate the notion of the camera's ability to produce objective documentation, and instead concentrate on its representational functions. The _Ê_standard_Êù filmic forms that inhabit documentary film derive their rhetorical strength from a politically conservative epistemology that still recognizes the possibility of _Ê_objective_Êù representation. The challenge in progressive documentary films is to recognize the conservative social construction of the filmic devices and the implications of their use in progressive documentary films.

Proponents of natural acquisition (Krashen, 1982, 1994; Krashen & Terrel, 1983; Shultz, 1991) have clashed with those who believe grammar-teaching is effective if appropriate methods are used (Swain, 1985; Montgomery & Eisenstein, 1986; Fotos & Ellis, 1991; Fotos, 1994; Eisenstein Ebsworth & Schweers, 1997). This study found that second language learners do acquire grammar naturally, but it also discovered that grammar-teaching using consciousness-raising techniques can significantly accelerate learning of the targeted grammatical function. This study investigated whether teaching the article system using consciousness-raising techniques to learners who did not have an article system in their L<sub>1</sub> (-Art learners) would result in improvement in article usage. The study also investigated whether these learners changed the ways they used articles in their writing. The subjects were 91 Japanese students (56 experimental and 35 control). The experimental students were given explicit instruction in article usage through consciousness-raising techniques. Students who were explicitly taught articles performed statistically better on cloze tests than students who were not explicitly taught. More importantly, the experimental group made significantly fewer article errors in their writing than the control group. ^ The study results support the theory that learners who do not have an article system in their L<sub>1</sub> acquire the zero article first, then the definite article and finally the indefinite article (Parrish, 1987, Master, 1988, 1997; Thomas, 1989; Yoon, 1993). The (-Art) ESL learners in this study most substantially improved their correct use of indefinite articles. The use of determiners that often substitute for articles, (e.g., demonstratives and quantifiers) tended to diminish as students gained confidence in article use. Learners also appeared to develop tactics for avoiding using the definite and indefinite articles which resulted in their significantly increasing the correct use of the zero (ê_ê_) article. ^ Grammar-teaching to second language learners will continue to be a subject of debate, but agreement may be closer than the debaters believe. ^","Experimental| ~check","",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Language, Linguistics|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Articles|Art ESL|Writing|Consciousness-raising","Major Adviser","James Dean Brown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(2) Do we truly have difficulty discussing works that are radically indeterminate? (3) To what sort of interpretive communities will discussions about hypertext lead? ^ By building on the research that has been done in hypertext studies and looking closely at actual works of literary hypertext, this study first argues that literary hypertexts are not as radically indeterminate as they have been presented. While the reader is granted some new liberties, the freedoms come at the costs of different sorts of constraints. Second, this study incorporates performance theory to suggest that all works of art present a level of radical indeterminacy. What makes hypertext different is simply that it does not hide its indeterminacy behind an illusion of sameness. Thus, this study argues that it is possible to discuss hypertext and thereby form communities. Yet, by building on the theories of Bill Readings, this study suggests that hypertext communities cannot focus on a horizon of consensus, but instead must look to form upon a horizon of dissensus. ^ In addition, this study models critical analysis of literary hypertexts by addressing three individual works of hypertext: _Ê_I Have Said Nothing,_Êù _Ê_Charmin' Cleary,_Êù and _Ê_Lust._Êù In this way this study seeks to initiate similar critical discussions of literary hypertexts. Last, this study provides discussion and analysis of classroom endeavors to discuss hypertext works. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Critical / Hermeneutical|Practitioner / Teacher Research ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Literature, Modern|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Technology of","Dissensual communities|Communities|Fiction|Hypertext","Chair","David Downing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These three women represent influential African American orators and authors who held significant governmental positions in the public realm. Jordan, Chisholm, and Guinier faced the exigence of having to balance their relationship with male and female African and White Americans in an effort to identify with multiple and diverse histories and audiences. In light of this exigence, the question that frames my analysis is: How did these contemporary African American women identify with diverse audiences in the public realm? In particular, I argue that Jordan, Chisholm, and Guinier employed the rhetorical strategy of interbraiding as a means to express a traditional value system while subtly disrupting the status quo and challenging the essentialist assumptions of African American womanhood. ^ It was critical for Jordan, Chisholm, and Guinier to identify with their dominant audience, not only because their jobs required it but also because they knew change for the less fortunate and under-represented must occur from within the governmental system. So, while they represented groups on the margins of mainstream society, they still needed to function effectively with influential individuals and groups in key decision-making positions. The rhetors therefore crafted value systems that both affirmed (by working within) and opposed (though indirectly) the dominant American value system. To accomplish this, the rhetors used the rhetorical strategy_Êîinterbraiding. Interbraiding is a rhetorical strategy through which a rhetor blends values rhetorically in an effort to identify with her audiences. An analysis of interbraiding illuminates how Jordan, Chisholm, and Guinier communicated through values_Êîalbeit differently_Êîto identify with their audiences. ^ My analysis illuminates how the rhetors used interbraiding to craft rhetorical models that enabled them to identify with diverse audiences, challenge the essentialist assumptions associated with African American womanhood, maintain a focus on traditional mainstream values, and subtly disrupt the status quo. I examine how the rhetors' rhetorical models were distinct in form and efficacy and suited to their unique rhetorical contexts. Another important dimension of my study is my discussion of how Guinier's experience was different from that of Jordan and Chisholm. Whereas Jordan and Chisholm's rhetoric worked to de-essentialize the distorted narrative of African American womanhood, Guinier's rhetoric, by contrast, was essentialized by it. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Historical / Archival|Clinical / Case Study ~check","",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Biography|Black Studies|Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Value|Jordan, Barbara|Identification|Chisholm, Shirley|Lani Guinier|Rhetorical","Adviser","Mark Lawrence McPhail",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The sociological significance of the city was determined by utilizing Mary Tew Douglas's group and grid model to examine archaeological, numismatic, epigraphical, and literary evidence that provide a record of the social role of the cities in first-century Asia Minor. The rhetorical value of the symbol of the city employed Elizabeth Schê_sler Fiorenza's poetic-rhetorical approach that seeks to discover the symbolic world created in a text. ^ In chapters 1 and 2, an analysis of the prevailing social views toward the institution of the city in first-century Asia Minor determined that the cities were strong group, weak grid social settings characterized by politics, religion, kinship, civic pride and competition, and the imperial cult. The symbols of the Roman emperor and Rome as a city/kingdom gave identity and unity to the citizens of the cities of Asia Minor. Those failing or refusing to participate in acts of loyalty to the empire and the emperor were seen as a threat to the social order and faced varying degrees of social pressure. ^ In chapter 3, John's usage of city in the Book of Revelation was examined. John's use of city revealed a strong group, weak grid sociological setting similar to the cities of Asia Minor; however, John replaced the demand for loyalty to the empire with a demand of loyalty to the one upon the throne, the Lamb, and the city/kingdom in which they reign. The city functioned as a powerful rhetorical symbol that allowed John to collapse geographical location into spiritual location using the polar opposites of the New Jerusalem and Babylon as the extremes from which the recipients were to choose. The rhetorical value of the city as a sociological symbol allowed John to challenge the existing social order, to exhort the unfaithful in the believing communities, and to encourage the faithful who were facing social pressures. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Rhetorical Analysis|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Religion, Biblical Studies|Sociology, Theory and Methods|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Rhetorical value|Revelation (Book of)|Sociological symbol|City","Adviser","Gerald L.

Analysis of the data revealed the faculty was meeting the majority of their students' cognitive needs_Êîthe way an individual processes information. Field Independent learners are more analytical, more competitive and can learn in isolation. Field Dependent are more global, less competitive, more social, and can learn in groups (Ming and Patty 183; Goodenough 6; Griggs and Dunn 14). The teachers were addressing their students' Field Dependent needs in the manner they conducted their classes. According to Jimenez, after Hispanic immigrants have been in America several years, they begin to become Americanized and develop into a Field Independent student as are most Anglo/European Americans. Although many of the students who must repeat First-Year Composition, according to some faculty, were truly irresponsible and lazy, a large portion of the repeaters may actually be _Ê_in between_Êù or Field Intermediate (Meng and Patty 183) students who, because not yet fully Field Independent, were no longer Field Dependent, but were not yet fully Field Independent.

Each chapter examines the artifactual traces and concrete practices of readers who are often left out of the sweeping narratives that try to account for the state of literacy today: anonymous readers in a Midwestern public library, Oprah's Book Club readers, student readers in a composition class, and composition teachers as readers of their students' writing. I ultimately argue for the value of grammars of difficulty_Êîplace, emotion, use_Êîfor readers, teachers, and scholars to better understand and participate in contemporary reading practices. ^ My argument is based on an understanding of reading as an interpretatively open, materially grounded, and socially embedded act. It is informed by composition theory, cultural studies, and print culture studies, insisting on a focus on the local and the particular_Êînot the ideal but the real, not the generally located but the specifically situated_Êîand on an investigation of difference, of what falls outside conventional genres, disciplines, and frameworks. My project understands readers as having agency, as making choices; it responds to critics who fail to recognize reading in _Ê_unsanctioned_Êù places; and it considers ways in which readers use literacy as a tool in ordering (and perhaps disordering) their everyday lives.

Communication in any context is difficult, but especially so in medicine, where practitioners must communicate effectively with patients and other practitioners, often switching from one audience and context to another in a matter of seconds. Despite the recent recognition of communication's vital role in healthcare, many patients remain dissatisfied with their medical care. By examining the research on medical communication and communication training, this dissertation traces the evolving approaches to communication training, from a scientific, objective, and biomedical model to a humanistic, subjective, and patient-centered one. In addition this dissertation answers two research questions: (1) why are medical practitioners still, to a large degree, ineffective communicators? and (2) how might rhetoric help to resolve the problem? ^ Using a process of deductive inquiry to integrate research from several fields, this dissertation suggests that physician assistants (PAs) might help ease some of the tension between the biomedical model and the humanistic one. Because of both the similarities and the differences between physician assistant's and physicians' education, PAs are excellent candidates for training in rhetoric. Since PA students are trained in primary care settings, where prevention is often favored over intervention, they are in a position to communicate rhetorically with their patients: often, their objective is to educate, to evaluate, to interpret, and to persuade. In addition, because PA education is typically oriented toward primary care, PAs have more opportunity for continuity of care and established relationships with patients. Therefore, teaching physician assistants to think rhetorically_Êîto construct and deconstruct language events systematically and thoughtfully_Êîwill help them to develop as more effective medical communicators. Injecting a rhetorical education into medical communication training can, this dissertation argues, help reunite the science of medical care and the art of medical rhetoric. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Medical rhetoric|Physician assistants|Rhetorical training","Chair","Stuart C.

Thus, when we acknowledge the political nature of literacy and the fluidity, ubiquity, and epistemic force of power, we are forced to recognize the futility of the liberatory pedagogies that try to justify and defend margins while simultaneously working to progress beyond those margins. To this end, using feminist epistemology as my primary methodology, I interrogate the rhetoric of marginality by defining the ideological forces guiding this rhetoric and developing a possible rhetorical framework by which educators may more effectively reshape this rhetoric in ways that maintain cultural diversity in American higher education rather than regulate and silence it. ^ Accordingly, I divide the ideological forces shaping and guiding the rhetoric of the margins into two matrices: the Matrix of Value and the Matrix of Ideology. I define the rhetoric of the margins as the spaces between that which is a part of the _Ê_regime of truth_Êù (Foucault) and that which is a part of one's own social location. Therefore, these matrices inform the ways we manipulate, negotiate, or fall victim to the oppressive forces of the margins. ^ Chapter One, _Ê_The Rhetoric of the Margins,_Êù takes up the problem of defining writing center work within the margins, arguing that writing center work shaped by the Matrix of Value perpetuates the status quo through the ideologies of progressivism and justification and, therefore, ineffectively serves our non-mainstream writers. Conversely, the Matrix of Ideology disrupts the status quo by persuading those located at the margins to challenge the ideological structures of the dominant group (the _Ê_center_Êù). ^ Chapter Two, _Ê_Silencing the Margins, Ignoring Power, and Justifying Ourselves,_Êù illustrates some of the important ways that work shaped by the Matrix of Value has further marginalized non-mainstream students. Chapter Three, _Ê_A Failing Democracy,_Êù and Chapter Four, _Ê_The Feminized Writing Center,_Êù define and critique the composition theories and value-driven metaphors guiding second-wave writing center work. These chapters reveal the ways these metaphors and theories work to perpetuate the dominant cultural codes of the institution and force students to suppress marginalized identity markers. ^ Chapter Five, _Ê_Conflicts, Contact, Struggles,_Êù begins the second part of this dissertation, which explores the exciting possibilities of writing center work framed by the Matrix of Ideology. In this chapter, I illustrate how metaphors like the contact zone (Mary Louise Pratt), <italic> la mestiza</italic> (Gloria Anzaldua), and _Ê_passing_Êù (Pamela L. Caughie) may restructure writing center work in ways that embrace the epistemic privileges marginality affords. Chapter Six, _Ê_Tutor Training <italic> La Mestiza</italic> to _ÊÑPass_Ê_ in the Contact Zone,_Êù develops possibilities for implementing the Matrix of Ideology in the virtual and physical writing center.

As such, this research reconceptualizes the sociocultural function of the vernacular and develops a framework, The Template for Analyzing Vernacular Discourse (TAV), in order to further reveal the essential socializing role, the importance to cultural diversity, and the possibilities of overturning hegemonic ideologies that inhere in the vernacular. ^ In order to frame this template, a historical survey of the relationship between language and identity in the West is used to contextualize contemporary attitudes towards the vernacular. The literature clearly illustrates that these attitudes are the result of the deliberate privileging of the elite standard as the exclusive mode of public discourse for more than 500 years. The main purpose of this review is to denaturalize the ideological relationship between the standard and its established legitimacy. This relationship has a definitive history that shows how and why specific _Ê_values_Êù continue to plague discussions of nonstandard languages today, which have been the victims of hegemonic thinking for centuries. ^ There are currently few frameworks appropriate for systematically analyzing vernacular discourse. Many of the methods currently employed by scholars in this area are often the very same methods used for analyzing standard discourse. Using these methods presumes that the function of the vernacular is the same as the function of the standard. As such, many of these tools fail to capture the dynamics existent at the core of vernacular discursive formations. In addition, while the goal of many of the contemporary scholars has been to highlight the positive impact of the vernacular, usually its liberating potentiality for marginalized peoples, these analyses often adopt an uncritical stance because of the failure to challenge the centuries old assumption that the vernacular is fixed as the discourse of the marginalized. ^ The Template for Analyzing Vernacular Discourse (TAV) is specifically oriented towards highlighting the unique characteristics and functioning of the vernacular in culture. In so doing, this template reevaluates the vernacular in terms of its unique characteristics in order to de-essentialize marginality and, thereby, demonstrate the importance of such discourses to cultural vitality in the contemporary mainstream. Such analysis illustrates that as the vernacular increasingly claims space in public discourse, it becomes an effective strategy for personalizing relations of production and consumption for a broad range of society. ^","Cultural-Critical Studies|Model-Building|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,0,1,"Speech Communication|Language, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Sociocultural|Discourse|Ethnolinguistic vitality|Vernacular","Adviser","Richard L.

(2) What is the institutional evidence that faculty participated in the development of the EWP? (3) What is the institutional evidence that the EWP is institution-wide in conceptualization and scope? (4) To what degree has the development and implementation process been congruent with the Four-Frame Model for organizational change developed by Bolman and Deal (1997)? ^ The research was a qualitative study using a case study design. Eastern Illinois University, located in Charleston, Illinois, was the case study institution. The case study was conducted in accordance with the protocol established in <italic> Research Designs</italic> by John W. Creswell (1994). ^ Information was gathered from multiple resources. A literature review related to organizational change and assessment in higher education was conducted. A history of assessment at the university was conducted through examination of archival data. Minutes taken from meetings of the Committee for the Assessment of Student Learning were reviewed and analyzed. Minutes from the Writing Across the Curriculum and the Council on Academic Affairs were also reviewed and analyzed. Interviews were conducted with eight faculty members and administrators who serve on the Committee for the Assessment of Student Learning. In addition, interviews were conducted with eight faculty members who taught English 1001 and English 1002, the courses that initial EWP submissions were submitted from. The assessment practices were analyzed to evaluate their congruence with the Four-Frame Model developed by Lee G. Bolman and Terrence E. Deal (1997). ^ The conclusions indicated that faculty and administrators consistently demonstrated in their interviews that the Electronic Writing Portfolio and the University's mission statement are linked. Faculty also consistently demonstrated that faculty was engaged in the development of the Electronic Writing Portfolio. Interviews also indicated, however, that administrators believe not enough faculty were engaged in the development process. The research also indicated, that, in the second year of implementation, the issue of second tier assessment has not been resolved. This indicated congruence with Bolman and Deal's (1997) political framework. This framework states that conflict is natural and inevitable. ^","Historical / Archival|Interview / Focus Group ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Electronic Writing Portfolio|Change process|Writing|Eastern Illinois University","Adviser","Greg Ulm",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many composition scholars have proposed theories about the cognitive processes that support writing, and have suggested pedagogies based in these theories, but too often this work has evolved in isolation from the research carried out in other fields. I hope that by taking this interdisciplinary approach, I can rough out some avenues for fruitful future exploration and lay to rest some misperceptions that currently hinder our teaching. ^ I introduce this study by sharing a brief literacy narrative, and then in Chapter One lay out the range of theories held in the composition community about writing, learning, and thinking processes. In Chapter Two, I examine how Multiple Intelligence (MI) Theory can add to our understanding these processes, and consider recent attention to cultural context. China stands out as a particularly useful example by demonstrating very a different but effective pedagogy. Recent neuroscience research supports MI Theory, and I consider how it explains the existence of multiple intelligences in Chapter Three. In Chapter Four I shift to more practical concerns; the media required by non-verbal intelligences are hard to bring into classrooms, but computer technology offers solutions to some of these difficulties. I discuss my own experiences designing an on-line writing tutorial as an example of how neuroscience can be applied to teaching with technology, then describe an introductory literature class in which I used technology to address multiple intelligences. I suggest paths of further inquiry, identifying gaps in current research on teaching with technology. When discussing computer technology, we must ensure that students can cross the _Ê_digital divide._Êù I look at recent studies of access to computers and the internet; analysis of these results gives a clearer picture of how we might ensure that technology serves our students, rather than acting as another stumbling block. ^ To close, this study looks forward, suggesting questions to be addressed in the future, as well as practical steps teachers can take now, to begin addressing multiple intelligences in their college writing classrooms. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research|Model-Building ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","College writing|Multiple intelligence|Teaching","Director","Peter Elbow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It examines legal practitioners' and consumers' critical awareness of disciplinary knowledge and situational exigency using the discourse of antitrust law, conceiving rhetoric as deliberative and productive, and rhetors as conscious agents operating at the intersection of theory and practice who critically negotiate their dialectical relationship. This helps explain the relationship between formal knowledge (i.e., <italic>episteme </italic>) and practical knowledge (i.e., <italic>phronesis</italic>) as they constitute productive knowledge (i.e., <italic>techne</italic>), and, by extension, rhetoric itself.

It is therefore surprising to note that little has been written concerning the phenomenon of remakes until very recently. In this dissertation, I investigate three feature films that remake a single plotline: Akira Kurosawa's <italic>Yojimbo</italic> (1961), Sergio Leone's <italic>Fistful of Dollars</italic> (1964), and Walter Hill's <italic> Last Man Standing</italic> (1996). This international collection of remakes provides an excellent opportunity to look at the practice of remaking as each film is remade on a different continent and adapted for a vastly different audience. Each film is analyzed through the method of close textual analysis as well as compared and contrasted with its previous or succeeding incarnation. This analysis is based in a rhetorical understanding of film and offers insights into ways in which audiences might read each filmic remake. Literature surrounding the remakes, including industry lore and critical citations, are also considered as a network of allusion becomes apparent. Issues of lineage, authorship, setting, character, and technology are explored across the three films. Concepts of agency are seen as pivotal to the analysis of setting and character while the use of allusion becomes essential to each director's status among his peers. This essay does not attempt a general theory of film remaking, but rather, keeps the focus on the specific and localized shifts presented in this particular series of film remakes. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Cinema","Walter Hill|Kurosawa, Akira|Remakes|Yojimbo|Italy|Japan|Sergio Leone","Advisers","Thomas W.

This model identifies three rhetorical elements fundamental to prayer: a scene of address, a speech act of invocation, and an attitude of reverence. Prior to explicating elements of this model in detail, I consider, in Chapter One, the intellectual challenges involved in characterizing prayer as a category of human symbolic activity. In Chapter Two, I examine the political implications of recognizing prayer as a language of communal discourse and identity, especially in democratic and pluralistic societies. ^ In Chapter Three, I consider prayer as a scene of address, a conception by prayer's speakers of the possibilities for relationship with some divine audience open to verbal appeal. This fundamental assumption that divine audiences possesses, even to a perfect degree, the capacities to be addressed reveals the extent to which language is constitutive of relationships. I explore the range and configuration of relationships between prayer's speakers and audiences in light of prayer's character as an extension of discursive relationships among human beings. ^ In Chapter Four, I consider prayer as invocation, a specific articulate act of address that calls upon a divine being to come and to be present. Invocations are the central speech act of prayer because they make possible all others verbal overtures. They not only call upon divine audiences but they characterize the relationships between human and divine beings in ways that exert persuasive force upon both speaker and audience. ^ Chapter Five identifies an attitude of reverence as fundamental to prayer. A reverent stance involves accepting one's condition as dependent and subordinate within some relationship of hierarchy. It necessarily takes a form of addressed toward an objects of reverence. Prayer is the epitome of such reverent address. ^ Chapter Six recapitulates this study and concludes that prayer depends upon the conceptual inter-relationships among these elements of address, invocation, and reverence. ^","Model-Building|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Religion, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Rhetoric|Prayer|Language","Chair","Mark B.

Even disciplinary practitioners struggle to answer this seemingly simple question. As Gerald Graff notes, _Ê_the quest for a precise definition of the discipline of English has been a persistent one since the founding of English Studies as an academic subject about a century ago._Êù Recently, however, this search for identity has taken on more urgency. _Ê_In many ways it seems that the quest for identity,_Êù writes Sidney Dobrin, _Ê_has become the central mission of contemporary English departments._Êù While there have been numerous disciplinary histories of the major sub-disciplines of English Studies (linguistics, literature, composition, and creative writing), there is currently no history of the ê_berdiscipline of English Studies. ^ <italic>What We Talk About When We Talk About English Studies</italic> attempts to shed some light on this question of disciplinary identity by providing a genetic history of the institutionalization of English Studies in the American college/university. As a genetic history, <italic>What We Talk About</italic> acknowledges diversity within the population being studied and uncertainty regarding genetic inheritance. <italic>What We Talk About</italic> does not provide a census, but focuses on certain institutions, scholars, and administrators at the expense of others in the belief that they represent the dominant genes of the institutionalization of English Studies. ^ In tracing the rise and institutionalization of English Studies, <italic> What We Talk About</italic> identifies the ideals underlying the adoption of English Studies as the four C's_Êîculture, citizenship, correctness, and capitalism. Two of theses ideals, culture and citizenship, represent the ideals of the classical college, while the other two_Êîcorrectness and capitalism_Êîrepresent ideals more closely associated with the modern university. While the history of what we talk about when we talk about English Studies may not provide the conceptual coherence necessary to unify the discipline, it can help us to understand what we have in common, how we came to be organized the way we are, and, perhaps, help us to understand where English Studies might fit in the new corporate university. ^","Historical / Archival ~Read|Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Linguistics|Literature, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Creative writing|Linguistics|Literature|English Studies","Adviser","Maureen Daly Goggin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this dissertation, I take as the object of my study two groups of primary sources_Êîthe autobiographical rhetorical pieces that appear in a set of five main books of essays by and about working class people and postings to a national working class academic listserv. My purpose in examining these texts is to compare definitions and experiences of _Ê_working class scholars_Êù as conveyed by the writers and to explicate and analyze these definitions and rhetorical strategies. This study argues for the existence of a shared discourse among working class intellectuals that developed from the autobiographical essays the scholars created for a core set of published texts, the working class listserv, and additional related texts. These shared narratives give insight into working class scholars' beliefs, actions, education and worldviews as the writers attempt to understand the ways class has acted on their lives and their scholarship. On a larger scale, this study investigates how people tell stories about themselves and how these stories evolve over time to become stronger and more similar to each other, the longer the discourse exists. ^ In their discourse, the working class academics give voice to members of an emerging and identifiable common discourse. Texts in this discourse include commonalties of form and thematic content that circulate freely among members even though the discourse community is widely dispersed geographically. The working class writers use a common language to characterize their experiences and to speak meaningfully to each other about them. Exploring the classed discourse and difficulties expressed in these texts sheds light on American class structures, and suggests ways in which universities might better serve and retain working class people. ^","Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check|Critical / Hermeneutical|Model-Building ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, Sociology of|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Academy|Working class|Scholars|Class","Director","Roxanne Mountford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Employing Marxist critique, I examine the ways institutionalized higher education perpetuates problematic dominant socio-economic structures as well as the possibilities available from sites of higher education for challenging those structures through critical pedagogy and community-based programs. ^ I contextualize my analysis of current practices in community-based learning by deconstructing the rhetoric of liberal ideology embedded within both the current and historical discourse surrounding the mission and development of public higher education with extensive analysis of the Land Grant Act in chapter one. In my discursive analysis of the discourse and history surrounding the creation of land grant colleges, I explicate the importance of a theory of cultural hegemony as it relates to universities functioning under dominant cultural logic. ^ In chapter two, I analyze specific university-based community outreach programs in order to deconstruct and situate the rhetoric and practices of these programs in a broader socio-economic context. I draw out theories of cultural hegemony from Marx and Gramsci to identify and characterize American liberal capitalism as a system which depends upon perceived freedom and equity while requiring inequity and exploitation. I situate <italic>higher education </italic> within that system as a cultural institution that provides necessary means for capitalism (in the forms of technology, knowledge, and trained labor) as well as creates ideological apparatuses to contain possible resistance to the dominant system. I deconstruct and re-theorize the ways in which voluntarism and community service enable contemporary capitalism to remain hegemonic, and I look specifically at such activities generated from and institutionalized in higher education to critique the implications of this relationship. ^ In the third chapter, I argue that although the tendencies of dominant institutions are to contain _Ê_radical_Êù or transformational practices, no system is an utterly closed system. Consequently, the critical enactment of community-based activities in higher education may provide an opening for counter-hegemonic responses, but only through a carefully articulated theory of critical pedagogy. Drawing on Paulo Freire, Paula Allman, and others, I lay out the principles of critical pedagogy. I also outline what I understand to be necessary limitations on institutional work and institutionalized critical pedagogies based on the analyses of the previous chapters. ^ Based on that critical pedagogy, in the final chapter I outline a practical method of enacting critical community-based work by looking at the issue of accountabilities, outcomes, and measurements in order to identify practices that may serve to create conditions for counter-hegemonic, transformative activities to occur. I conclude the dissertation with some reflection on activities in the university other than community-based learning programs where critical pedagogy has a significant role to play. ^","Cultural-Critical Studies|Ethnographic ~check|Critical / Hermeneutical|Philosophical / Theoretical","",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Service learning|Community-based|Higher education|Critical pedagogy|Cultural hegemony|Rhetoric|Outreach programs","Director","Thomas P.

The focus of this analysis is to determine what students might view as the rhetorical purposes and strategies of the cover letter. What can students do and not do in such documents? While much research has delineated the importance of reflection as a tool for learning, there have been very few case studies to determine what students can do rhetorically when they reflect. The goal of this study is to analyze and explicate the rhetoric itself in these 88 cover letters using Aristotelian appeals, Toulminian argumentative structures, and Burkian performative elements such as act, scene, agent, agency, purpose, and the scene/act ratio. ^ The results of this study suggest that, while these students could review what they learned, offer support for their choices in the portfolio, and supply information about their learning, they did not often reach a level of critical analysis that demonstrated metacognitive ability. The majority of students did not examine or discuss changes in their assumptions about thinking and writing. ^ This research seeks to redefine reflection as a series of stages_Êîreview, reflexive analysis and metacognition. Not only is a single reflective document like a cover letter not sufficient practice in reflection for students to achieve metacognition, but also a portfolio cover letter, by its nature, privileges rhetorical purposes that can be antithetical to self-assessment, such as pleasing and impressing the teacher. Also, if students are not trained in reflection throughout the semester and expected to move toward a deeper analysis of their thinking and writing, a portfolio cover letter will not be a culmination of their thinking about writing. ^","Discourse or Text Analysis|Model-Building|Clinical / Case Study ~check","",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,0,3,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Teacher Training|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Cover letter|Reflection|Portfolios","Adviser","Kathleen Boardman",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, despite their integral role in building disciplinary identification, early records of the field often mask key elements related to the formation of composition's history and tradition: inconsistencies between definitions of the field; competing audiences and ideologies among a diverse group of composition students and scholars; and disputed, changing interpretations of the field's boundaries and designs. Such elements are crucial to understanding the relationships between disciplinary formation and institutional ethics, as the manner in which composition histories are recorded influences how the field's constituents perceive their roles, their purpose, and their ideals within the university. ^ This project therefore analyzes the rhetoric of three full-length disciplinary histories commonly cited within composition scholarship_ÊîStephen North's <italic> The Making of Knowledge in Composition: Portrait of an Emerging Field</italic> (1987), James Berlin's <italic>Rhetoric and Reality: Writing Instruction in American Colleges 1900_Ê_1985</italic> (1987), and Susan Miller's <italic> Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition</italic> (1991)_Êîin order to classify the rhetoric of composition history and to interpret this rhetoric's implicit and explicit inscription of ideological assumptions regarding the nature of disciplinary roles, boundaries, and agendas. To that end, the study descriptively and analytically addresses five historiographic features appearing in the histories: the stated purpose of each work and its relation to previous histories; the construction of audience within each work; the prevailing themes and keywords grounding the texts' visions of disciplinary history; and the structures of the historical narratives. This analysis reveals three noteworthy patterns in early histories: the texts share difficulties in forging historical methods appropriate for their purposes; they fail to adequately address the needs of their intended audience members; and they reinscribe the traditional characterization of composition as institutionally marginalized and powerless. ^ Using Joseph Harris' <italic>A Teaching Subject: Composition Since 1966 </italic> (1997) as a model for building revised conceptions of composition studies, the project thus recommends three discursive elements useful to creating more critical and ideologically self-conscious accounts of disciplinary formation: methodological disclosure; ideological contextualization; and rhetorical transparency. ^","Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~read ?|Rhetorical Analysis ~check|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, History of|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Disciplinarity|Ideology|Composition","Supervisor","Alice Gillam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Numerous studies have indicated that using computers to write changes the way students write, what they write, and the quantity and quality of that writing. However, studies disagreed about how these changes occur, whether they are positive or negative (or neither), and what psychological dynamics, such as attitude, are involved, to what degree, and how they relate to each other. Affect in general and specifically toward computers has been studied, with several computer attitude scales developed during the 1980s and 1990s. However, these scales did not measure attitude nor subsequent behaviors toward complex computer applications, such as the Internet; moreover, none existed for use in English composition.

Winnicott, Gregory Bateson, and Erving Goffman suggests that the element of play has intriguing potential for the teaching and learning of writing: repositioning students in relation to dominant discourses, providing an avenue for risk-taking and experimentation, and offering students and teachers a subtle means to negotiate social roles. However, play as a discrete subject has drawn little attention in composition studies, and as yet there has been no attempt to enact a curriculum that deliberately foregrounds the element of play in all aspects of a composition course. The study described in this dissertation fills this gap. In Chapter 1, I discuss interdisciplinary theories of play in relation to work done in composition studies and develop a provisional definition of _Ê_play._Êù In Chapter 2, I present the methodology I used in this study, which focuses on three sections of a first-year composition course I taught during a single semester. In Chapter 3, I describe the curriculum I designed in light of the theories discussed in Chapter 1. I also relate my observations on how the curriculum was received, comment on my own experiences of play, and discuss spontaneous play initiatives.

Histories that focus on coherence, unity, and progression often elide precisely those methods of study and those purposes of scholarship that became unfashionable, that were marginal at their inception, or that produce inconsistencies in the historical narrative. A genealogical account of twentieth century communication studies offers us an opportunity to alter broadly shared assumptions about rhetoric, ethics, politics, and their interrelation. This dissertation investigates the discourses that surround and dominate communication studies in the twentieth century and utilizes a genealogical method to explore what possibilities for alternative modes of subjectivity, ethics, and politics might be available to communication scholars today. Through the study of a diversity of texts from the journals in speech communication, this dissertation maps out linkages and breaks between communication ethics and other sub-genres of communication studies in order to both demarcate limits established by dominant assumptions in the discipline and simultaneously to place in question the necessity or naturalness of those same limits. ^","Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Speech Communication|Education, History of|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Communication|Twentieth century|Rhetoric|Speech|Politics|Ethics","Adviser","Christopher Lyle Johnstone",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although many rhetoricians and journalists claim common ends of invigorating democratic politics, academic separation obscures these common ends and inhibits interdisciplinary interaction. The thesis of this work is that professors of journalism and rhetoric who endeavor to promote effective democratic discourse can and should seek means of collaborating to enact and foster the kinds of public participation they envision. ^ Chapter one finds compatible notions of democratic discourse processes presented by rhetoricians, journalists, and communication scholars. Synthesizing treatments across disciplines of publics, public spheres, public opinion, and press roles, the chapter offers a normative model showing how journalism and rhetoric can interact to realize publics and public opinion. ^ Chapters two through four illuminate developments in academic and public life that led to the disciplinary separation of rhetoric and journalism at the turn of the twentieth century, using as case studies Fred Newton Scott's teaching and Ida M. Tarbell's practice of public discourse. This examination suggests that some major historic differences between the subjects are now passê©. As journalism entered the academy, rhetoric was perceived as an academic and literary subject with little connection to public life. Scott's program of rhetoric and journalism at the University of Michigan, discussed in chapter two, illustrates public-academic tensions that separated the subjects. His neoplatonic rhetoric differs significantly from the Aristotelian and Isocratean practices that have since been revived among rhetoricians. Chapter three investigates professional impulses in rhetoric and journalism, as composition-rhetoric strove toward disciplinary status and journalism became a distinct vocation. College journalism followed extra-academic professional influences more than it did the rhetorical traditions then espoused in composition-rhetoric programs. As the study of Ida M. Tarbell demonstrates in chapter four, muckraking was more a rhetoric of public engagement than what was being taught by many rhetoricians in the early twentieth century. ^ Chapter five considers pedagogical implications of preceding theoretical and historical-critical insights, suggesting potential avenues for mutually beneficial interdisciplinary engagement among journalists, rhetoricians, and their students. ^","Historical / Archival|Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Journalism|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Public discourse|Ida M.

While some scholars have argued that well-established social movement organizations tend to occupy positions more in line with the status quo as they age, there are provocative cases in the field that challenge this perspective. In this dissertation, I examine two social movement organizations, The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and the Sierra Club, both of which continue to introduce new arguments and new messages into the public sphere and therefore encourage the public to embrace a larger degree of social change. ^ In attempting to explain how these organizations have developed their discourse in the last thirty years, I focus on the impact of key emerging radical groups within the larger movement. I ask: Does the rhetoric introduced into the animal protection and environmental advocacy movements by more radical groups affect the rhetoric of more moderate organizations in those same movements? I endeavor to answer this question by tracking and analyzing the rhetoric produced by HSUS and the Sierra Club from 1970 to 2000. In conducting my investigations, I explore whether attempts on the part of radicals to expand the realm of identification (Burke, 1950) by challenging taken for granted notions concerning the value of animals/the earth and offering counter-arguments can be found in the discourse of later campaign materials produced by the moderates. ^ In order to do this, I track shifts in the arguments presented by the moderate organizations both prior to and following the emergence of the more radical groups_ÊîPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and EarthFirst! Specifically, I explore whether following the introduction of a more radical ideology into the movement, moderates begin to challenge accepted norms concerning human relations with animals/the earth, ultimately setting the stage for a reinterpretation of that relation and a broadening of the existing sphere of identification. ^","Historical / Archival|Discourse or Text Analysis ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Sociology, Social Structure and Development","Moderate organizations|Social movements|Radical flank effects|Rhetoric","Supervisor","Dana Cloud",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although there have been many studies that comment on the connection between video games and culture, and several other studies that attempt to understand how playing video games may affect audiences, almost no video game studies actually study the material, formal, or interactive qualities of video game content. Of those studies that do discuss video game content, most are incomplete because they treat video games as a pre-composed static medium, which contemporary video games are not. Consequently, we have a very shallow understanding of video games and have no systematic way for understanding the ways in which ideological content may be communicated when people play video games. ^ This dissertation proposes a model to objectively dissect the video game as a dynamic and interactive medium. The first half of the proposed model is a grammar of video games, which consists primarily of terminological framework designed to elucidate the content with which gainers work with and within as they play a video game. This framework consists of objects, agents, commonly depicted interactions, commonly depicted programmed responses, and video game scenes. The functionality of this grammar is demonstrated through analysis of three games in the <italic>Final Fantasy</italic> series: <italic>Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy VII</italic>, and <italic>Final Fantasy X</italic>. ^ The second half of the proposed model is a method for studying the rhetoric of video games. The primary rhetorical resources of video games are <italic> orienting systems</italic>, which include regulating configurations, embedded narratives, and social systems. Through these orienting systems gamers are encouraged to identify and cause player-controlled agents to interact. The functionality of this rhetoric of video games is once more demonstrated on three games in the <italic>Final Fantasy</italic> series. ^ In the final chapter this dissertation proposes that further examination of the grammar and rhetoric of video games can give video game scholars insight into the potential ideological allegiances of video games.

I avoid taking a taxonomic approach to genre, instead treating the concept as a process, which situates the text within the social context of its production. Generic influence in this study means much more than the _Ê_textual correspondences_Êù of a taxonomic approach. In implementing this research method, I examine three elements which capture the richer concept of _Ê_social influence:_Êù (1) the social image of the act of production of the text, (2) the rhetorical dynamics of the act, and (3) the formal elements of the act. ^ This approach allows me to address three issues: (1) the relationship of genre to the agency and socialization of the writer; (2) the relative stability, or lack of it, in a generic form such as the manifesto; and (3) the ways in which the history of writing practices both constrains and enables the future writing practices of individuals.

A survey of customers revealed their capabilities and preferences for receiving documents. The company-customer culture is largely viewed through the theoretical lens of Feenberg's critical theory of technology. I show how the company took an instrumentalist view of the technology.

Had the company espoused a critical theory of technology, the result might have been more positive for the company and for the customers. I also examine the decision-making process and failure to implement an electronic publishing system from a literacy standpoint, looking at how those in power to make the electronic publishing decisions had a very low level of literacy in that area.

This dissertation explores the roots of the modern suspicion of rhetoric, challenges its philosophical basis and points the way towards a conception of deliberation that is friendlier to rhetoric. ^ Part One of the thesis argues that the roots of the modern case against rhetoric can be found in the form of social contract theory first put forth by Hobbes. In asking citizens to alienate their judgments to a sovereign, Hobbes aimed to undermine the practice of rhetoric that appealed to those judgments. While he certainly made use of rhetorical techniques gleaned from his humanist education, I argue (against recent scholarship) that he turned those techniques against the heart of the tradition from which they came. That tradition offered techniques for facilitating controversy; Hobbes's rhetoric aimed to surmount or avoid controversy. I go on to claim that in spite of their more democratic sensibilities, both Rousseau and Kant inherited and even radicalized Hobbes's opposition to the sort of deliberative controversy imagined in the rhetorical tradition. ^ Part Two of the thesis studies the accounts of rhetoric found in Aristotle and Cicero, paying special attention to the dangers they saw in persuasion and to the remedies they proposed. From Aristotle I derive concepts of <italic> deliberative partiality</italic> and <italic>situated judgment</italic>, suggesting that the dangers of rhetoric can be curbed not by principles of impartiality but by certain sorts of appeals to citizens' existing passions and prejudices.

However, within a classroom setting, analysis of these narratives can serve as an important entrance point for discussions of the ways that race, class and power function in American culture.

This ancient rhetorical tradition has played an integral role in their emergence as aspiring writers in the aftermath of the Soweto rebellion of 1976. While their arrival on the literary scene is typically characterized as a breaking of the silence, their expertise as social commentators and community activists has roots in African patriarchal organization in which private and public spheres are delineated along gendered lines. Black women's growing public presence in the Black Consciousness Movement that launched an orchestrated assault on apartheid is less a result of their incorporation in mass education and Western epistemology than a resourceful return to their rhetorical roots. ^ Chapter one explores the oral traditions as sites of resistance to patriarchy and the provision of opportunities for claiming agency and individual identities, strategies that have been essential for anti-apartheid activism when learning to write. Chapter two considers the impact that literacy has had on black women, beginning with its introduction by missionaries in the nineteenth century and continuing through the apartheid era. Reasons for black women's late arrival on the literary scene are discussed in relation to pedagogical practices and philosophical positions concerning the role of black women in a white dominated society.

More than 1100 essays, written to four different prompts, were analyzed and coded for two features: levels of development and organization schemes. ^ Findings for organization indicate that while more students choose to write FPTs, writers are just as likely to earn high scores with some _Ê_other,_Êù non-formula, organization scheme. The only clear association between organization and score was between disorganized or short essays and low scores. Level of development was a better predictor of high score, with writers who chose more specific and varied strategies to elaborate their ideas receiving increasingly higher scores on this assessment. ^ Additional findings include the following: Many students organized their essays according to the bulleted questions posed after the prompt. The study also found that for grade 10, essays organized by an _Ê_other,_Êù non-formula scheme were better-developed than those organized as FPTs. Similar to other studies, number of sentences utilized in the support section of the essay was positively correlated with score. Most writers primarily developed their essays by reason and example/explanation although it was often difficult to distinguish the role of these strategies in context. Many writers used cause and effect statements for much of their support, especially among 8<super> th</super> grade writers. Finally, essays that earned top scores, even when organized via formula, usually incorporated at least some narrative, preceded topic sentences with background information or commentary, and used effective figurative language. ^","Discourse or Text Analysis| ~check|Model-Building","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, Tests and Measurements|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Eighth-grade|Writing assessment|High-stakes testing|Tenth-grade","Professor in charge","Carol Vukelich",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Exploring tensions between constructions of literacy as <italic>just</italic> a set of skills to be learned and the need for a <italic> just</italic> literacy that recognizes the ongoing, contested nature of social, material, and discursive struggles across and between communities of difference, I argue that prevailing discourses of segregation within U.S. political economy deeply influence the ways literacy is defined and evaluated. Furthermore, such discourses delineate the ways (textual) bodies are filtered through public spaces. In considering three transitional periods within the field_Êîthe turn-of-the-century emergence of first-year composition at elite institutions of U.S. higher education; the institution of remediation during the 1970s; and the inclusion of community service in higher education curricula_ÊîI demonstrate how fetishistic constructions of literacy, those which are disembodied and dematerialized, most directly serve the interests of scholars and teachers in composition and rhetoric as well as students from the white professional middle class. My aim is to show how the needs of under-represented groups_Êîprimarily working classes and communities of color_Êîare left unexamined and, in some situations, boldly ignored in a relentless effort to teach the literacy practices and discursive modes that most closely resemble those of white, professional, middle-class communities. I contend that many of the literacy challenges faced by contemporary U.S. institutions can be directly linked to the prejudicial and oppressive ways that institutions_Êîand the people within them_Êîconstruct educational spaces that conceive of literacy as simply utilitarian. In addition to this critique, I call for the rigorous inclusion of embodied and materialist literacies within mainstream institutional spaces. Applying feminist Sara Ahmed's theory of embodiment in postcoloniality, I offer examples from disciplinary praxis and a case study of the Highlander Folk School to begin unfolding a theory and practice of embodied literacy, an activist project that challenges literacy educators and Euro-Western institutions to more justly address the (corpo)real processes involved in generating discursive knowledge between-not within_Êîacademic and community spaces. ^","Historical / Archival|Cultural-Critical Studies|Ethnographic ~check|Practitioner / Teacher Research","",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Literacy|Service learning|Activism","Adviser","Rebecca Moore Howard",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Little study had been done of conference teaching with ESL writing students, who typically display a wide range of levels of language competence, of purposes and goals for their study, and of educational and cultural backgrounds. Other research indicated that effective teaching occurs when expert and novice interact, that higher order thinking is stimulated by direct tutorial instruction, and that conference teaching enhances development of skills necessary for independent thinking and learning. Students reported that some of their needs were effectively met by conference teaching, while others were no more effectively met than in other writing classes. Analysis of audiotaped conferences suggested that novice-expert interaction resulted in increased motivation for the writing task, increased student input and control of the instructional agenda, opportunities for instructor modeling of effective thinking and strategies, and timely critique and performance shaping. Analysis of audiotaped interviews further suggested that conferences had enhanced higher order thinking as seen in acceptance of multiple solutions to problems and of inherent uncertainty in research, attempts to impose meaning and order on data, and mental effort directed toward elaboration and judgment-making. Coding of student texts suggested use of higher order thinking skills and enhancement of independent thinking and learning as seen in attempts to self-regulate learning, to scaffold on previous learning, and a sense of pride and validation of efforts. Benefits of conferenced writing instruction may extend beyond its previously theorized capacity as a medium for individualized instruction and enhanced student participation, to include its effectiveness for stimulating higher order thinking and fostering independent learning and thinking. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research|Discourse or Text Analysis|Interview / Focus Group ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Conferencing|Writing","Major Professor","Tony Silva",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Individuals are constrained in communication and identity by the communicative forms that are available. Forms are durable, but innovation may occur. I consider the influence of three texts on environmental discourse and the constitution of environmental citizenship: Rachel Carson's <italic> Silent Spring</italic>, Aldo Leopold's <italic>A Sand County Almanac</italic>, and Ian McHarg's <italic>Design With Nature</italic>. ^ Literary theorist Kenneth Burke proposed that forms have consequences for action. Forms help to create expectations and attitudes towards the natural world, identities for our selves and motivations for our actions. Using Burke's dramatism and textual analyses, I show the sources and consequences of the forms of these three texts for the identities and actions of those involved in environmental planning. The social identities expressed through these texts help to constitute important identities of environmental citizenship, including popular movements and professional associations. The way the three texts are applied in discourse shows how the forms embodied in the texts are translated to action. ^ The concept of rationality that once dominated planning has been under attack. This rationality was to provide universally applicable norms for planning. Theorists have turned to communicative approaches to describe a more contingent planning. Some focus on the particularities of individual situations. Part of their purpose has been to undermine the still-prevalent concept of rationality as universal. Part of my purpose in describing the forms of environmental discourse is to show that it is both possible and necessary to generalize between communicative situations. In order to understand communication in particular situations we need to understand the broader contexts of communication. ^ Using dramatistic analysis, forms can be identified and their effect on motivation can be understood. The research will help planners to understand how environmental literature influences the situations of environmental planning.

The site, a national wildlife refuge and accompanying visitors' center, features research and environmental education on the restoration and preservation of tallgrass prairie and oak savanna ecosystems. The study draws on theory and practice of contemporary museums engaged in professional communication about the environment and engages cultural studies' articulation theory in its approach. Conventional qualitative methods of interviews, document analysis, and observation are employed. Five types of data were analyzed: documents (including newspaper articles, consultants' reports and correspondence, and promotional information from the refuge and prairie learning center); interviews; signage (both exterior and interior); displays as part of the exhibition's narrative; and video and web-based materials. The study argues that the visual, verbal, and spatial narratives present at the refuge and learning center challenge prevailing assumptions about land use and participation with the environment and calls on visitors to engage deeply in the progressive environmental work of the refuge. Such engagement with nature and such understanding of how museums function in communities gets redefined at this site. A series of tensions in the exhibition's narrative serve as the primary units of data analysis: wild and tame; technology and Nature; heritage and progress; hidden or understated and revealed or promoted; constructed or controlled and natural or free; and stated or articulated and assumed or ignored. The study concludes that museums as rhetorical and political spaces reshape perceptions of knowledge-making and community, that museums provide innovate sites for education and social action, and that the tensions that exist in such spaces need not be reconciled and, in fact, may be necessary in order to intervene in the arguments that are constructed around technical concepts for various audiences. ^","Ethnographic ~check|Critical / Hermeneutical","",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Technologies|Social action|Interpretive exhibition|Prairie|Museums|Narrative|Rhetorics","Major Professor","Charles J.

As an example of the type of material which scholars may now be interested in working with, it centers on an edition of a lecture given by the West Virginia artist-journalist David Hunter Strother on John Brown nine years after the insurrection at Harper's Ferry. This material was chosen because it was locally available, unpublished, both locally and nationally important, and of the dimension which would have formerly placed it on the margin of paper publication. ^ Chapter one shows how the theory of editing has evolved from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present day. Chapter two deals with the introduction of computing techniques to literary studies, the subsequent experimentation with new pedagogic and creative forms, and the beginning of digital editions. Chapter three moves on to the work of the edition and the technical and software choices which have been made for this particular example. It provides a rationale for choosing the particular document both as an example for the dissertation and as a piece of scholarship that will contribute to studies in civil war history and biography. ^ The edition of the David Hunter Strother lecture is archived in Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).

BRADLEY","Ease in composition studies","University of Florida","Ph.D.",2003,212,"For many Americans, the idea of _Ê_ease_Êù shapes understanding of complexity and difficulty. Though many consider ease of use a twentieth-century phenomenon associated with personal computers, its origins date from the seventeenth century. _Ê_Ease in Composition Studies_Êù investigates the role of ease in American culture, especially college-level writing. ^ I begin by defining ease and tracing its history through four critical periods of development dating from 1700 to the present. I show that ease can be defined using a list of eight qualities opposed to other important concepts: comfort, transparency, effortlessness, simplicity, pragmatism, femininity, expediency, and pictorialism. Calling on the work of Evan Watkins, I show problems which can occur when ease is uncritically demanded or mobilized_Êîas is frequently the case when consumer models of ease, based on simple transaction, appear in educational contexts. ^ With ease defined, I demonstrate that current-traditional rhetoric, the simplified approach to writing developed in American nineteenth-century colleges, includes a pedagogy based on ease. Nineteenth-century composition portrays the act of writing, writing style, and teaching writing as easy, and position writing as the gatekeeper for the _Ê_life of ease._Êù By investigating textbooks, teaching methods, and strategies which writers of supposedly easy rhetorics use, and calling on the work of Lucille Schultz and Sharon Crowley, I identify specific connections between writing and ease, charting the transformation of ease in the classroom from close identification with _Ê_easy_Êù pedagogical techniques (atomization, alliteration, and gradation) to a less clearly defined, but no less powerful concept. ^ The connection of ease and writing established in current-traditional rhetoric was not disrupted by the pedagogical reforms of the 1960S and 1970s. Today ease shapes the development of teaching writing using computers and new media. Can composition instructors continue to mobilize ease to teach electronic _Ê_writing_Êù technologies, given the differences in institutional practices and subject formation associated with them_Êîwhat Greg Ulmer calls _Ê_electracy?_Êù My research suggests otherwise.

The study examines how theories of care ethics, spirituality, and personal development can help enhance the creation of student-centered service-learning projects. The dissertation poses a fundamental question: What does it mean to _Ê_care_Êù in a service-learning composition course? ^ Chapter One provides an overview of the current applications and compatibility of service-learning theory in the field of composition. Chapter Two discusses care ethics as one means of developing caring relationships in service-learning reflective writing and discussions. This explanation is based on the work of care theorists also known in the field of service-learning. However, a majority of the chapter specifically implements practices as discussed in Net Noddings' <italic>Educating Moral People: A Caring Alternative to Character Education</italic>. ^ Chapter Three examines a second theory that can enlighten service-learning discussions and which flows naturally from care ethics: spirituality studies. This chapter addresses varying uses of the term spirituality and how, in the educational realm, it may refer to more than one's personal faith. ^ Finally a theory of personal development and _Ê_self-authorship_Êù can ground discussions in the composition service-learning classroom. Chapter Four intentionally discusses students' learning journeys as foundational for work in composition service learning. Marcia Baxter Magolda's work, <italic> Making Their Own Way: Narratives for Transforming Higher Education to Promote Self-Development</italic>, forms the framework for this examination of how being attuned to students' process of personal development can aid service-learning practitioners as they seek to bridge the gap between school and _Ê_real life,_Êù the world of the classroom and the world of the community at large. ^ Though each chapter ends with ideas for implementation, Chapter Five specifically discusses issues of implementing these theories in practical ways in the composition classroom, sharing stories of the author's teaching experiences. ^ This theoretical and practical approach helps examine service-learning in the composition classroom as a tool to develop life-long learning goals. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Practitioner / Teacher Research| ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Service learning|Composition|Care","Chair","Claude Mark Hurlbert",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I argue that the power of white normativity, because it has forever managed to avoid intellectual scrutiny, invisibly pervades all levels of society, including our disciplinary work in the field of composition studies. As such, this project, using a cultural studies methodology, first explores the historical, social, political, legal, and rhetorical practices within America that have collectively and institutionally constructed racial identity; it then demonstrates how such practices have specifically camouflaged the existence of white normativity in order to reinscribe the prevailing systems of domination. ^ Extending the exploration into composition studies, I argue that over the last 20 years, many progressive composition scholars have worked, using postmodern discourses such as cultural studies, to broaden their understanding of race and racism. And while we as a discipline claim, in the name of cultural studies and multiculturalism, that we are concerned about racial inequities, I contend that the power of white normativity has caused our disciplinary efforts to border on inadvertent racism, for our critiques concerning matters of race have focused primarily on only the marginalized Other, with little or no attention given to the white race or the prevalence of white-normative ideology. I argue that we simply cannot give a full-bodied assessment of matters of race if we do not factor in the invisible power of whiteness. ^ As a corrective to the white solipsism that clouds our disciplinary vision, I attempt to turn the critical gaze back on whites by offering several postmodern theoretical discourses of critical race scholarship_Êînamely, Racial Formation Theory, critical whiteness studies, and critical race theory_Êîalong with the hopeful theories of hegemony and articulation as a means first to understand the white-normative ideology and unconscious racism that binds us, and then to work diligently to disrupt them.

My research included both local communities and online communities, where students collaborated with community partners, participated in intercollegiate discussion boards, and joined online communities of their own choosing. In order to assess the impact of extra-classroom writing assignments on student engagement and <italic>rhetorical sensitivity</italic> (the ability to recognize and critically examine writing tools and rhetorical situations and one's position(s) therein) in extra-classroom writing, I observed students in multiple rhetorical situations, used short questionnaires, and interpreted student-(co)authored texts according to an ethnographic research methodology_Êîone specifically suited for the study of extra-classroom writing, based on the action-reflection cycle central to Deweyan educational philosophy. Ultimately, I argue that rhetorical sensitivity obtains when students view their writing from multiple standpoints and that engagement ensues when students perceive a _Ê_real_Êù exigency for their writing, with limited teacher monitoring or surveillance. ^ I conclude by arguing that extra-classroom assignments hold potential for student engagement and increased rhetorical sensitivity to the degree that students perceive such assignments as serving some function other than meeting a teacher's requirements. Creating such a sense of rhetorical exigency is challenging in the context of required writing classes where assignments are typically made and monitored by the teacher. However, teacher surveillance in local community writing can be reduced if institutional support for service learning substitutes for monitoring by the teacher. In this sense, I challenge Ellen Cushman's recent claim that the teacher-researcher is key to sustaining community service writing. In my recommendations about online communities, I employ Michel Foucault's and Johndan Johnson-Eilola's theories of power to explain that some level of surveillance is always present on the web, but that teachers can reduce students' sense of being monitored by choosing technologies that foster less constrained participation and by inviting students to participate in online communities of which the teacher is not a part. ^","Ethnographic|Interview / Focus Group|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Service learning|Writing|Community-based writing","Adviser","Carrie S.

Both rhetorical and feminist theory continue to struggle with, and fall short of, finding solutions to the problems raised by the body's inescapable prominence as the problematic excess that does not belong with, or fit neatly within, the frameworks through which theorists and critics understand both rhetorical efficacy and individual and social agency. ^ Eve Ensler's play, <italic>The Vagina Monologues</italic>, challenges rhetorical critics, feminist activists, and theorists of all kinds, to re-think the relationship between the body, particularly the female body, and current understandings of <public> and <private>. By doing so, Ensler's play also challenges us to explore the status of the <body> within rhetorical and feminist studies. <italic>The Vagina Monologues</italic>' emphasis on the female body as not only a site for individual experience but also as a source of individual agency and rhetorical activity, makes this play a rich source for insights into how and why women's bodies operate as they do in public arenas. ^ Drawing upon bodies of theory including rhetorical studies, counterpublic studies, and gender theory, this project seeks to map the common ground among these diverse literatures in order to better understand the status of the <body> in contemporary social discourse. Then, by turning to lessons learned from media studies scholarship concerning the potential polysemy of rhetorical texts, an analysis grounded in both critical rhetoric and qualitative inquiry is performed. This analysis suggests that the <body's> complex discursive status makes rhetorical efforts at social change, such as those launched by <italic> The Vagina Monologues</italic>, not only difficult, but also potentially dangerous for the groups these efforts are designed to aid.

By using these tropes, these scholars actually undermine their goals of empowering users, especially marked individuals, because they reify unreasonable expectations. As an alternative to these tropes, three heuristics have been developed as a possible foundation for computer users' digital subjectivity composing process: (1) having knowledge of the social ideology, (2) having knowledge of computer use and conventions, (3) understanding how the ideological design of the technology prescribes users' subjectivity. The viability of these heuristics is examined in the context of English Composition courses taught in computer-mediated classrooms by international teaching assistants (ITAs). To test this viability I posed the questions: (1) why do ITAs need compensatory strategies to manage the rhetorical situation of the classroom? (2) what effect does computer technologies have on this rhetorical situation? and (3) what appropriate technological practices should ITAs use to manage the American classroom? As a means of giving the ITA participants agency in the epistemological process_Êîsomething that has absent from many studies about ITAs_Êîthe study has been designed using postcritical research methods. This data collection includes: (1) interviews with the ITAs, (2) observations of the classroom (or rhetorical context), (3) collection of public documents (i.e., web pages, emails, PowerPoint presentations, online conferencing transcripts) shared between the ITAs and their students, and (4) questionnaires designed to learn how the student audience responded to their ITAs. From this study we learn that not all ITAs need compensatory strategies and this need is not entirely predictable.

To determine which training methods should be used, the current best practices of writing assessment and program-level evaluation were reviewed. The findings of the case study, in a synthesis with these best practices, form a heuristic guide that any institution could use to create a new or evaluate an existing writing program. ^ The case study was conducted over a two-year period at Rasmussen College, a four-campus, private two-year career college of 1,500 students in Minnesota. In its assessment of its writing program, the College uses a portfolio model to collect samples of student writing from across the curricula of all its programs. In its faculty training efforts, the College exposes all faculty members to the criteria of good communication_Êîsuch as the concepts of audience and purpose_Êîthat lead to effective transactional communication. After the faculty members are exposed to these concepts, the instructors assess students' written communication, as compiled and submitted in their graduate achievement portfolios. The institution also explores the best methods for incorporating written communication activities and assignments within each of its classrooms. ^ During the training, the College works to develop a strong sense of community among the faculty members. Case study findings reveal that an engaged, student-focused faculty community is one of the key factors which drive the successful implementation of an interdisciplinary writing and assessment program. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Program evaluation|Writing across the curriculum|Interdisciplinary writing program|Accreditation","Adviser","Earl McDowell",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many renowned thinkers from a variety of academic disciplines have engaged this question offering thoughtful, if not fully satisfying, solutions. Typically current solutions account for the complexity of political, liberal discourse but lack similar sophistication concerning religious language. Following the lead of H. R. Niebuhr, I question the wisdom of treating religion as a monolithic whole. ^ This study will demonstrate how our current theories are unable to account for the significant and identifiable differences within the various representations of religious language. The central assertion of the study is that if any theory hopes to provide moral guidance in our political dialogue, it must incorporate a sophisticated understanding of religious language. In order to reveal how the current theories ignore essential differences in religious speech, I form a typology based on present scholarship that will provide a means to engage the vast array of theories concerning religious speech in political discourse. Through the utilization of a typology, recurring themes that to this point have been overshadowed in the present debate, such as an overly simplistic view of religious speech, come to light. ^ After identifying and defining the typology, I will examine the speech of two leaders from relatively recent Protestant movements, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Reed. Both men rely on religious language in their public speech and, therefore, according to current theories, the language of these two men must be treated equivalently. However, through an analysis of the speech of these two leaders, I will demonstrate that a fundamental difference exists in the way they understand and, consequently, engage dialogue. King views dialogue as a dynamic, transforming force while Reed understands it merely as a means toward attaining political clout in order to conserve his constituents' way of life. ^ Analyzing the speech of King and Reed within the context of the typology leads to the conclusion that any theory worthy of consideration concerning the appropriate role of religious speech in political dialogue must be able to account for the complexity that exists within religious speech. Our political dialogue will not flourish without such moral guidance. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Religion, General|Theology|Political Science, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Political dialogue|Public discourse|King, Martin Luther, Jr.|Religious speech|Reed, Ralph","Adviser","Robin W.

Writing is generally understood by the academy and public as universal, basic, and formal. College writing instruction, therefore, is imagined as remedial (teaching basic, high-school skills), servile (teaching foundational skills rather than a legitimate area of study), and inexpert (requiring no disciplinary knowledge). When its FYC curricula reinforce these conceptions, Composition _Ê_teaches its own prison._Êù In contrast, curricula which resisted misconceptions by teaching <italic> about</italic> writing, exposing students to comp-rhet research, might undermine labels of remedial or inexpert, improving writing instruction and the discipline's image. ^ In case studies of two FYC curricula, students demonstrated three conceptual models of writing_Êînetworks of _Ê_game knowledge._Êù One writing model pictured writing as hardware (form) on which any software (content) can run, syntax universally characterizing _Ê_good writing._Êù A second model pictured two kinds of writing, structured school writing precluding authenticity and authentically expressive writing precluding structure; structured writing corresponded to the Hardware/Software model. A third model, not native to students, pictured writing as contingent, not universal, and form and content as inseparably arranged material, not independent, making writing a holistic text-producing activity. ^ One curriculum studied used a typical pedagogy of academic inquiry and argument. The other used a _Ê_research_Êù pedagogy in which students read comp-rhet articles, reflected on their own literacy histories and processes, developed research questions from personal experience and open questions in the field, and conducted primary research on them. Participant-observation of both courses, context-sensitive analysis of students' writing, pre- and post-course surveys, and interviews suggested that unlike the standard pedagogy, the research pedagogy resisted misconceptions of universal writing and independent form and content. The research pedagogy helped students see texts as people speaking and helped them understand the activities of reading and producing contributive scholarly texts. These students produced uncommonly successful academic writing and gained disciplinary awareness. ^ The study also suggested that instructor game knowledge is central to such a project and that few Composition instructors have sufficiently expert understandings of writing. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research ~check|Ethnographic|Interview / Focus Group|Critical / Hermeneutical","",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Curriculum and Instruction|Education, Higher","Public conceptions|Teaching|Writing|First-year composition|Disciplinary status","Adviser","Thomas N.

The strong focus on sermon <italic>content</italic>, including solid biblical exegesis and consistent theology, has relegated issues of sermon <italic>form</italic> and sermon <italic>context</italic> to a secondary level. In general, sermons are believed to happen at the mouth of the preacher and not at the ear of the hearers. The message of grace, humanization, and liberation does not reach the hearers effectively because of the lack of rhetorical resources. ^ The goal of this dissertation is to suggest rhetorical resources for Brazilian Lutheran preachers that enable them, (a) to take sermon hearers more seriously in their homiletical praxis by actually listening to them and, thus, discovering their words, themes, stories, fears, hopes, dreams, problems and, (b) to choose more participatory and democratic sermon designs. My contention is that once _Ê_a_Êù and _Ê_b_Êù happen, sermons will face more strongly the dehumanizing consequences of economic globalization and ensure humanization and solidarity as one possible evangelical response. ^ The rhetorical resources that this project proposes to examine come from three different fields: Latin American Protestant liberation theologies, the New Homiletics of Fred Craddock and Eugene Lowry, developed in the United States, and the liberation pedagogy of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. A <italic> Homiletic of the Oppressed</italic>, my proposal in this dissertation, grows out of the conversation I have with these scholars and their disciplines. ^ Before the analysis of the works of Craddock, Lowry, and Freire I place globalitarism (defined as economic globalization without democratic control) within the realm of theological debate and stress why it should be a concern for Brazilian Lutheran preachers. I lift up the voices of theologians who are reflecting on this economic model and its perverse consequences. These theologians of liberation provide the knowledge of the context out of which this proposal grows and to which it hopes to be useful. Their theologies of liberation and humanization give preachers the possibility to discern the tension_Êîand hopefully take a stand_Êîbetween two very different and contradictory projects for the world. One is the project of economic globalization and globalitarism that causes dehumanization, oppression, and social exclusion. The other is the project of liberation through the radical grace of God in Jesus Christ that makes possible a new world in which humanization and solidarity abound. ^","Cultural-Critical Studies|Rhetorical Analysis|Discourse or Text Analysis ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Religion, Clergy|Theology|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Craddock, Fred B.|Lowry, Eugene|Freire, Paulo|Oppressed|Rhetorical resources|Homiletics|Liberation pedagogy","Coordinator","Thomas G.

In the wanted poster, instrumental realism literalizes the desire to recover the referent that motivates all realist modes. ^ Cultural critics have not studied the wanted poster, in part, because the text is assumed to be a blunt, self-evident instrument of the police, a tool for capture, and an empty vessel for communication.

By considering the wanted poster not only as a tool of capture but also as a cultural performance, one gains access to the symbolic charge of the text's cumulative history and the performative power of the form itself.

The research was a qualitative case study design where GAs' written reactions to students' writing was the main unit of analysis. Four PhD students new to the Writing Program in Fall 2002 were selected for the study. Data collection procedures included GAs' written reactions to assignments and drafts over the 15-week semester; three interviews with GAs; ENGL 111 classroom observation; GA's teaching metaphors; and, participant observation in both the theory and pedagogy seminar and small group response and evaluation workshops. ^ Analysis included reading GAs' written reactions in light of students' writing (Straub and Lunsford), the assignment, and GAs' values, priorities, and intentions (Prior). Six categories, representing the focus of GAs' written reactions, emerged from the data: writing task, rhetorical strategies, writing processes, critical thinking, common interest, higher order concerns, lower order concerns, and grades. Findings indicate that GAs react rhetorically to student writing: GAs' written reactions varied according to the writing task, student history, and student growth; and, GAs made comments, marks, and symbols focused on rhetorical strategies across assignments. ^ Course-wide curricula can shape the focus of GAs' comments as well as provide a mechanism for GAs to define their own teaching styles. GA training needs to explicitly link teaching and assessment and support the goals of the writing program: (1) response and evaluation should be discussed in relation to specific assignments, (2) GAs should complete students' assignments in advance, particularly if the curriculum requires less familiar genres (i.e., reflection, editorials), and (3) time should be spent with GAs on aligning their reactions to the rhetorical specification in assignments. ^","Clinical / Case Study|Model-Building ~check","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Education, Teacher Training|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Graduate assistants|Student writing|Writing assignments","Chair","Stuart C.

The classes were taught by an experienced monolingual English-speaking adjunct instructor who implemented three group projects in her classes.

Robert Butler developed the concepts surrounding life review over 30 years ago claiming life review's universality and need to address unresolved issues before death. Over time, many studies explored and often confirmed the therapeutic effects of the activity and extended the definitions to include autobiography, memoir, and reminiscence. Since these early studies, however, some life review activities have evolved into life review for self-discovery, particularly in activities for elders, which requires different language prompts than clinical settings. In these instances, it is particularly important to clarify audience and purpose. ^ The study explores the background for structuring language in the form of scaffolds and discusses the evolution of life review, noting the tensions that exist in moving from clinical settings to reviewing self in non-clinical settings. The study documents the experiences of six senior citizens and a researcher who participated in written life review specifically designed to explore memories with the purpose of developing an individual's sense of connectedness and coherence over the life span. Through use of scaffolded writing prompts, each participant reflects on his/her own experiences, fleshing out experiences and constructing life stories that provide reflexive accounts as measured by the Narrative Process Coding System designed by Angus, L., Levitt, H., & Hardtke, K. (1999), a system designed for analyzing therapy language. ^ This research analyzes the process by which purposeful development of writing scaffolds occurs and how the subsequent scaffolds can be useful as an aid in written life review. It also questions issues of audience, purpose, focus, and power that language scaffolds may present. Interviews further enhance and uncover participant experiences. The researcher-in-practice details her experiences in scaffold creation through thoughtful reflective notes asking what influences or restrictions occur while creating and using language scaffolds.

Composition studies has been especially attentive to these discursive challenges, but most of this scholarship has been conducted through interviews or has been related through personal narratives. Thus, little attention has been given to the actual written discourse of these women, including the process of transformation, a process that continues to take place over the entire course of a career. By examining the body of work by three women in composition studies, this study pursues two primary objectives: (1) to provide a better understanding of these transformations of academic discourse and (2) to elaborate the pedagogical implications of such transformations for the teaching of composition. ^ First, I provide a theoretical and historical discussion of voice in composition studies in order to provide an over-arching focus for locating the changes in the women's writing. Then, through stylistic and discursive analysis, I trace the voice development of three women in composition studies by studying every publication produced throughout each of their careers. The three compositionists studied are Nancy Sommers, Lillian Bridwell-Bowles, and Wendy Bishop. These women _Ê_cross the lines_Êù between the personal and the academic, the experimental and the conventional, and the creative and the scholarly to challenge, particularly, the notion that an academic voice is only something acquired and not continuously developed. I conclude from my analysis that the three women's academic voices are continually transformed over their careers, a type of development that reinvigorates the concept of _Ê_writing as a process_Êù in composition studies. For these women, to transform as a writer is to move through a process first of imitation in an apprenticeship and mastery mode and then on to becoming an agent of change_Êîa creative academic writer who develops her own interests and critiques options. I suspect that this similar pattern among the three compositionists' process of voice development indicates a transformation process common in general among women academic writers_Êîa hypothesis that needs further study. Finally, I discuss the study's implications for teaching. These implications suggest the need to make students more aware of the voice transformation process, especially to assist them in viewing voice as a work in progress and in realizing the dissonant dynamics of their own evolving writing lives. ^","Discourse or Text Analysis|Cultural-Critical Studies ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Biography|Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Women educators|Academic discourse|Wendy Bishop|Nancy Sommers|Lillian Bridwell-Bowles|Composition Studies","Supervisor","James Comas",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, since the relevant literature suggests that gender inequities and power distribution generally tend to favor men, greater emphasis is placed in this study on the empowerment of women. ^ The over-arching research question is: What empowerment strategies does Jakes use in his homiletical rhetoric? This question, along with subsidiary ones, is answered by an analysis of five, purposefully selected, videotaped sermons preached by Jakes. ^ The study is framed around the neo-Aristotelian approach to rhetorical criticism. Of particular interest is why Jakes' ministry stresses distinction between the genders in an apparent attempt to empower them. This study notes that Jakes deliberately sets out to make his <italic>Woman Thou Art Loosed </italic> and his <italic>Man Power</italic> crusades central to his ministry. This makes his ministry unique, and his rhetoric worth selection as the focus of this investigation. ^ It is demonstrated here that Jakes uses particular strategies to motivate his audiences_Êîparticularly the women. The study concludes that Jakes holds women in high regard and therefore sensitizes them to their potential to perform their God-designated roles in life. Jakes' gender-oriented approach to homiletical rhetoric in the sermons under review has been carefully and deliberately designed for the motivation and empowerment of the genders, but particularly of women. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Discourse or Text Analysis ~check|Clinical / Case Study ~check","",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,1,1,1,0,3,"Religion, Clergy|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Gender empowerment|Jakes, Thomas D.|Sermons|Rhetorical","Adviser","Lyndrey A.

This dissertation explores such interactions and the ensuing rhetorical discourses shaping the emergence of a new scientific field, nanotechnology. The study focuses on the rhetorics operating in the creation and use of one of nanotechnology's main instruments, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), as well as the instrument's productions, atomic-resolution digital images. How the STM's images are produced and communicate affect those who use this visualization technology and those who view its productions, and so influence how science is communicated, ethical responses to nanotechnology, and nanotechnology's future visions as well as definitions. These effects are especially important to explore because these images' production and composition processes as well as uses depart from those of representational images. Therefore, how such images are persuasive, and what they persuade viewers of, becomes a crucial component of exploring the work of images as well as the formation of nanotechnology. ^ My analysis reveals that while conventional rhetorical strategies appear in the images and discourse produced, the effects of the STM's and resulting images' operations also create different strands of persuasive discourse based on interaction and participation. I analyze these visual, tactile interactions in regard to image production processes, the STM apparatus, and viewing practices. I also show how these interactions are deeply formative of nanotechnology, its visions, and its arguments. This interactive and rhetorical practice of image production provides a model for ethical and epistemological response that attends to the participatory, interactive promises and perils of nanotechnology, and I conclude by suggesting a few frameworks for how such a model of ethical response to nanotechnology could be deployed. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical ~check|Rhetorical Analysis","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"History of Science|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Subjectivities|Visualization technologies|Rhetorics|Scanning tunneling microscope","Adviser","Richard M.

I argue that it is important for the field to reclaim that study on grounds that are pedagogical, political, and practical. Chapter 1 lays the groundwork for the study, establishing style's importance during the process era (from the 1960s to the mid-1980s) and the overlapping _Ê_golden age of style,_Êù which featured many stylistic theories, traditions, and pedagogies. Chapter 2 challenges the tendency today to characterize style retrospectively as (1) a static part of _Ê_current-traditional_Êù rhetoric and (2) antithetical to invention, the favored canon of the _Ê_new rhetoric._Êù It establishes through historical analysis that, contrary to the _Ê_retrojection_Êù of this canon of rhetoric, style was actually seen as an innovative source of language creation during the process movement. Chapter 3 examines some of the ways that popular myths about style have filtered into the field, often through a group of public intellectuals who sometimes present style reductively. The analysis reveals that composition often resists style studies, in part because outside views construct both style and the field as remedial. As experts trained to study stylistic issues, however, compositionists are expected to address them; therefore, I argue that it crucial for the field to reclaim the study of style in its theory and practice. Chapter 4 makes the claim that even though style appears to be invisible in composition studies, it is ubiquitous, and the chapter examines areas where the study of style has diffused_Êîsuch as genre theory, rhetorical analysis, personal writing, and theories of race, class, gender, and cultural difference. The chapter both adopts and complicates Lauer's notion of the _Ê_diaspora_Êù as the site of style's migration. Chapter 5 examines the field's interest in disciplines currently addressing issues of style and re-frames long-held stylistic debates. In proposing a model for rereading the history of the period, focused through scholars and textbooks, it claims that the study of style is in crisis and renews the call to reshape the field's approach to the subject in the public sphere. ^","Historical / Archival|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Style|Public intellectuals|Diaspora|Composition","Adviser","Louise Wetherbee Phelps",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In my study, I show how the home healthcare entrepreneurs learn to write to construct an appropriate and consistent professional identity for their agency as they collaborate on business genres quite different from their more familiar nursing genres. Experimenting with genres on paper led the nurses to learn how to manage their own business with greater independence but also to reject or revise corporate requirements implicit in those genres. During my research project, I studied the genres of the employee handbook, the business plan, and various marketing materials. I show that as the entrepreneurs experiment with new genres, they learn to collaborate not only on writing but also on managing their business. This collaboration encourages them to make more independent business decisions, with mixed results, especially in the area of marketing. Thus, I ultimately investigate the conflict that results when professional nurses learn to write business genres, thereby learning how to manage their business as a professional agency rather than a corporation. Nursing as a profession tends to place significant emphasis on the welfare of the patients compared to a corporation, where the greater emphasis would be on profit and return on investment for shareholders. Therefore, my study contributes to the literature by providing a contrast between corporate writing and professional writing. I focus particularly on the role of business consultants, an understudied area in the field of composition. I also study the role of the academic consultant who is in a position to advise entrepreneurs learning to write business genres. Because academic researchers in our field are skilled in the discipline of communication, I argue that the goal of those researchers can and should be to attain an active role on a collaborative team composed of consultants typically hired by new business owners. ^","Ethnographic|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Business Administration, Management|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Health Sciences, Health Care Management","Technical writing|Entrepreneurial communication|Ethnographic|Riverside Health Services|Writing","Adviser","Ellen Barton",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study analyzes perceptions of learning shared by ten veteran urban high school teachers who completed a graduate course delivered through the model. Research questions ask if teachers found gains achieved were commensurate with learning challenges, what factors of school and district affected the value of staff-development, whether perceptions changed over time, and what learning profiles were a best fit for the model. The study also examines the larger contexts of a Professional Development School technology-infusion initiative and a district-level technology-training program. ^ Research methods include content analysis applied to data collected longitudinally through written program evaluations and interviews conducted over a four-year period. Analyses of email messaging and other electronic communications provide further triangulation of data. The study provides cross-case and case study treatments, the latter providing small-scale maximum variation sampling of learning profiles. ^ The study reports teachers entered the program preferring informal, on-site workshop instruction to all other technology-training options, and that this preference proved durable. Teachers dismissed graduate coursework and district-level training, citing issues of trust and expressing themes regarding respect and lack of respect, and the value of local knowledge. Teachers differentially perceived the pace of the course and relationships with instructional staff, according to their self-assessed computing skill levels.

These structures include the relationships between people, machines, environments, and policies. In particular, I examine the growing genre of the university technology plan as it relates to the forming and constraining of potential relationships to technology. I argue that, as institutions solidify their relationships to technology via policy statements, opportunities exist to transform those institutions through rhetorical intervention. This rhetorical intervention is what Porter <italic>et al.</italic> term _Ê_institutional critique._Êù I argue that planning for technology enacts a form of institutional critique by altering the perception of technology and by providing leadership opportunities for rhetorical action. ^ As a highly visible and socially convincing form of progress, technology becomes a means of organizing relationships, and it presents an opportunity to engage in and transform those relationships through strategic leadership. Writing programs, because of their fluid nature, high student contact, and emphasis on pedagogy and literacy, are well suited to take advantage of these opportunities. Chapters one and two work to position technology within the writing program by examining the ways in which technology is and is not being addressed in critical pedagogy and critical literacy studies. ^ In chapters three, four, and five I examine the administration of technology as a leadership issue. I look at the ways in which technology plans run up against issues of teaching, learning, and literacy. These discussions would benefit greatly from a discipline that has spent so much time on being reflective teachers.

In particular the case made for the role and value of personal writing by appealing to and making commensurate theories of language use and learning of theorists such as Jerome Bruner, Lev Vygotsky and John Dewey.

The reciprocal relationship between reader and writer asserted in this thesis is presented as a foundation for the reception of student writing. After a review of past studies of reading and responding to student writing_Êîincluding a discussion of the range of alternative methodologies for such reading and responding, the researcher offers, in contrast, a detailed description of a phenomenological hermeneutic approach as well as the analytical tools used for this study derived from Halliday's social semiotic linguistics.

Such productive criticism applied to patriarchal rhetoric counters oversimplification and stereotyping and reveals more productive ways of seeing women than those currently offered in mainstream rhetorical artifacts. Toward this end, both written and visual artifacts are examined for their metaphorical content. ^ As part of the metaphorical analysis, this study provides an introduction to Wiccan history and beliefs in order to examine how Wiccan perspectives encourage a variety of multivalent identities and roles. For example, by presenting accused medieval witches as resisting patriarchal norms and hierarchies, Wiccan rhetoric thus offers more empowering identities than that of mere _Ê_victim._Êù ^ In order to illustrate how anti-feminist rhetoric uses imagery drawn from medieval representations of witches, this study analyzes two of the larger metaphoric motifs underlying both: sexual deviant and animal. Mainstream texts portray witches as threats to patriarchal society, yet media witches also eagerly participate in that social order and reinforce its control with their enthusiasm for its normative gender roles. Although mainstream texts seem to present two disparate means (destruction or domestication) of dealing with female identities outside social norms, both _Ê_solutions_Êù assume that patriarchal control is the only option to prevent the chaos of female independence. Those who will not submit must be destroyed. Furthermore, this study examines a tension within mainstream texts that present women as threatening male power yet also lacking their own power. ^ Finally, Wiccan discourse offers productive alternatives to patriarchal rhetoric's limited and severe understandings of identity. Wiccan rhetoric embraces positive valences of the witch image that patriarchal rhetoric previously denigrated and corrupted. It also introduces and supports additional positive aspects of the witch image. This study examines the untapped rhetorical potential of contemporary Wiccan discourse to provide productive alternatives to mainstream rhetoric's constrictive norms. ^","Cultural-Critical Studies|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Religion, General|Sociology, Theory and Methods|Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Identities|Wiccan|Mediations|Metaphor|Rhetoric|Feminist","Chair","Robert Ivie",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, the business world's celebration of worker individuality and freedom operates in the service of governance by leveraging aspects of employees' identities, encouraging loyalty and creativity, and reducing possibilities for tension in the workplace. The value that corporations place on adaptability and flexibility means that work-related training can become boundless and constant.

In both sites, I observe the literacy practices of citizenship and public activism. I argue that democratic spaces inherently include unequal power structures, so teachers and scholars need to observe the literacy abilities citizens use to address these power structures. More specifically, I define the term _Ê_activist literacy,_Êù to include agency, coalition building and collaboration, an awareness of power structures, and the deliberate use and interpretation of language. Activist literacy is related to critical literacy but is informed by both the classroom and the community and is marked by rhetorically savvy literacy practice in the pursuit of local change. I also consider how individuals shape their civic identities in relation to the _Ê_impartial civic public_Êù (Young) and how collaborative writing informs the rhetorical use of genre to make change. These examinations lead me to construct a pedagogy of activist literacy for the classroom and the community. ^ Overall, my dissertation theorizes democracy as a literate practice and literacy as a democratic practice. As such, I complicate literacy scholars' arguments about the rhetorical use of literacy while speaking back to critical pedagogy's fundamental assumptions about teaching and learning. Critical literacy and pedagogy are democratic processes that emphasize understanding the relationship between language and power for social critique, self-transformation, and cultural change (Knoblauch and Brannon). Scholars such as Ellen Cushman and Jacqueline Jones Royster argue that literacy use is rhetorical and that citizens and activists can and do use literacy to take action in their lives. Activist literacy, then, is the rhetorical use of literacy toward the pursuit of access, democratic participation, and change. In the end, I argue for reconsidering the literacy and pedagogy of public writing and democratic participation to inform the spaces of the classroom and the community. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research|Discourse or Text Analysis ~check|Philosophical / Theoretical","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Political Science, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Community|Green Party|Democracy|Literacy|Activist","Supervisors","Joy Ritchie; Chris Gallagher",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis is primarily of narrative and visual texts that proliferated in the debate over ideal body size and shape that has emerged in the last fifteen years. By demonizing fatness and glamorizing slenderness for women and muscularity for men, our culture has rendered all bodies' shapes and sizes rhetorical. The body as material and visual rhetoric is interpretable as representative of character, with the fat body representing a lack of the virtues that seem inherent in the lean body: health, fitness, discipline, beauty. Narratives written about individual's bodies, including weight loss success stories, eating disorder memoirs, size acceptance narratives, and films that feature actors in fat suits, have the possibility to maintain or challenge prevailing views about body shape and size and the relationship between body shape and size and character/ethos. ^ The four narrative genres studied have emerged in mainstream cultural productions rather than what might be considered alternative media, and come from a wide variety of popular sources. These narrative genres, and also the visuals that accompany or transmit the narratives, are important pieces of the debate over acceptable body shape and size for men and women.

This project expands on the work of individuals such as James Berlin, Albert Kitzhaber, Stephen North, Robert Connors, and others who have written on the historical marginalization of composition within the discipline and Academy and offers a more specific interrogation of the position of composition within the discipline and the Academy in general. ^ In my work, I argue that the contemporaneous founding of the modern English department and the Modern Language Association allowed for the institutionalized relegation to a low status of composition and teachers of composition. That institutionalized low status eventually led to the marginalization, fractionalization, and specialization of a group of composition scholars who believed teaching to be a central concern for the discipline, as well as to the development of NCTE and CCCC. I further argue that a similar fractionalization and specialization within these smaller groups has left intact the institutionalized notions of status that led to their formation in the first place. I conclude by suggesting that in order to raise the status of composition in the discipline and the Academy, it is necessary to address the sources of marginalization directly as opposed to fractionalizing and specializing in reaction to it. ^","Historical / Archival|Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Teacher Training|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Teacher preparation|Organizational history|College composition|Composition courses","Major Professor","Debra Jacobs",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For scholars exploring the rhetoric of social movements and the public sphere, the environmental movement provides a fruitful avenue of research by which to consider the role of visual rhetoric in changing social consciousness. Drawing on a methodology that views social movements through a rhetorical lens, I explore how the visual rhetoric of the environmental justice movement challenges corporate practices and discourses that shape public perceptions of sustainable development and industry's commitment to open communication. In its efforts to redefine public understanding of sustainability, the environmental justice movement employs visual rhetoric to contend that industry's concerns for economic growth and profitability far outweigh its concerns for environmental stewardship. In its efforts to redefine public understanding of industry's commitment to open communication, the environmental justice movement employs visual rhetoric to illustrate how industry's notion of open communication constructs a public that is rhetorically ill-equipped to question industry's practices and successfully participate in public policy discussions. While the visual rhetoric of the environmental justice movement may redefine public consciousness with respect to sustainability and open communcation, the movement's visual rhetoric is nonetheless limited in its ability to fully promote public action to change these practices because the visual rhetoric examined in this study differs from the images of a culture accustomed to what Szasz refers to as _Ê_images of disorder._Êù Therefore, an analysis of the effectiveness of a movement's visual rhetoric must take into account the ways in which various institutional practices and discourses shape a culture's habits of vision, habits which can erode the effectiveness of certain visual rhetoric. Scholars in rhetoric seeking to expand their understanding of social movements and the public sphere by integrating studies of visual rhetoric must therefore consider how a movement's visual rhetoric challenges and redefines the practices and discourses which construct a culture's habits of vision. ^","Historical / Archival ~check|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Environmental Sciences","At-risk|Culture|Environmental justice|Rationality|Visual rhetoric","Major Professor","Helen Ewald",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This dissertation, taking a cue from classical sources, explores another important function of speechwriting: characterization. Although the literature on speechwriting addresses characterization and its two constituent elements, character and style, in various ways, it rarely enters into a sustained, conceptually grounded discussion of the topic. This study, in contrast, grounds its in-depth exploration of contemporary characterization in the classical concept of <italic>ethopoeia</italic>, for which the ancient speechwriter Lysias was praised. ^ The study first explores the means and ends of <italic>ethopoeia</italic> in classical authors such as Aristotle, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Quintilian, and the Greek authors of <italic>progymnasmata</italic>. It then presents four contemporary case studies, each of which features in-depth interview commentary and textual examples that illustrate the nature of characterization as practiced in a particular context: corporate, political, academic, and legal. As the case studies reveal, ethopoetic style involves the expression of character along various dimensions, from individualized to institutional to typed. The persuasive aims of contemporary ethopoetic portrayal are not unlike the aims identified in classical sources, although the speechwriters in this study place a particularly strong emphasis on the importance of not boring listeners. If a speaker is to win the favor of an audience, he or she must be interesting and engaging. ^ With respect to stylistic strategies for expressing character, the speechwriters advocate a number of principles from ancient theory, stressing in particular the importance of using natural, simple language. Other hallmarks of contemporary ethopoetic style include the use of stories, attention to authentic replication (in some contexts more than others), and an understanding of how best to work with a speaker's preferred style of delivery, which can be either an opportunity or a constraint. All of these considerations, if handled effectively, contribute to an appropriately characterful, apparently artless style, one well-suited to securing the favorable regard of listeners. ^","Historical / Archival ~check|Model-Building ~check|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Ethopoet|Speechwriting|Characterization|Art","Adviser","Karlyn Kohrs Campbell",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Skowronek (2000) introduced the concept of the preemptive presidency in his historical analysis of the presidency. Skowronek's work suggested that a preemptive president is not aligned with the popular polices of the day or the party that has been in control of government. This creates a problematic situation for the president who must try to place his stamp on politics while being constrained by the difference between his political philosophy and the political philosophy that dominates the political scene. An examination of Eisenhower's rhetoric on budget and taxation, agriculture, and civil rights illustrates that Eisenhower emphasized his independent persona, developed a _Ê_third way_Êù which married fiscal responsibility with moderate extensions of more liberal social policy, and played at the margins of change. His rhetoric emphasized themes of balance, interconnectedness, research and growth or progress. His strategic choices included avoiding attacking individuals, clearly defining his values, using his cabinet as lightening rods and surrogate persuaders, and linking policy to universal values. Eisenhower's approach to civil rights was different than his approach to other issues. Eisenhower used Executive Orders to create change with minimal Congressional notice while keeping his rhetoric neutral. With budget and taxation and agricultural policies, Eisenhower adopted a more publically persuasive role. ^","Rhetorical Analysis|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"History, United States|Political Science, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","President|Preemptive presidency|Dwight D.

It argues that affect---the complex confluence of feeling and judgment---is bound intricately to racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, etc. In this work I attempt to deconstruct the social construction of affect that fuels dominant white ideology---what some scholars call whiteness---in the context of white teachers and students in the cultural studies writing classroom. With the lofty yet ultimately empowering goal of effecting anti-racist change in the classroom and in the profession, I trace affective dimensions of whiteness (such as fear, blame, defensiveness, and denial) revealed by white teachers and students. Clinging to the myths of meritocracy, individualism, and the American Dream, white teachers and students often unknowingly perpetuate dominance based on white privilege. In this work I offer a pedagogical theory informed by the work of a variety of feminist scholars who consider the complex and ultimately powerful concepts of love and care. By problematizing their work and my own, I argue for a thoroughly self-reflexive, critical, feminist, anti-racist pedagogy that works to foster vital critical awareness in our students (and in ourselves). ^","Cultural-Critical Studies|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Whiteness|Antiracist|Pedagogy|Writing|Feminist|Affective|Cultural studies","Major Professor","Debra Jacobs",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First-year required composition courses and other writing requirements can act as barriers to college matriculation. Yet composition studies, which has as its focus writing students and student writing, has yet to commit to a thorough examination of all the factors that affect the experience of nonwhite students in composition classes. In order to engage in inquiry into the difference that race makes in students' classroom experiences, composition teacher-researchers must represent the race of those involved in classroom scenes because, as race studies (whiteness studies and critical race theory) demonstrate, racial difference has continuing effects on the experiences of whites and nonwhites despite the dominance of a post-racism ideology. ^ Using critical discourse analysis, this dissertation investigates the presence or absence of racial representations of teachers and students in texts in three areas of composition studies: teacher stories, basic writing, and collaborative learning. In each of these areas, stories and studies in which race is visible are discussed in terms of the insights about power and relationships that they offer. However, texts in which race is visible are decisively outnumbered by those in which race is not visible. In these texts, a discourse of racelessness is achieved through the discursive practices of colorblindness, conflating ethnic and racial difference, denial of racism, construction of nonwhites as inferior, and construction of nonwhites as alien. ^ This dissertation argues that student-present studies and stories should be encouraged because they contribute important pedagogical knowledge. The race of teachers and students can be ethically represented in studies and stories through practices that actively involve students and teachers in the research and writing process and a research focus on the role of the teacher's race in the classroom dynamic. In addition, composition should recognize and valorize the practice of counterstorytelling as a means of investigating racialized experiences. ^","Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography|Cultural-Critical Studies|Critical / Hermeneutical|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Race|Stories|Composition Studies","Adviser","Nedra Reynolds",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this instance, Western tradition is narrowed to some aspects and characteristics of Scottish Belle Lettres rhetorical tradition. Chapter 1 discusses African American preaching and suggests that it is not a monolithic art form. In addition, several terms are defined. African American sacred rhetoric is defined as a stream of African American preaching that appropriates some aspects of Western tradition for purposes of achieving social and political integration into the larger society. ^ Chapter 2 begins with a historical trace of Scottish Belle Lettres. Three primary headings are listed: Elocutionary Movement, Quintilian rhetoric and Hugh Blair and his lectures, on Rhetoric and Belle Lettres. Specifically, this chapter clarifies the significant contributions that Belle Lettres had for Scottish citizens' successful integration into the eighteenth century civil society of Britain. A similar practice of integration was achieved by way of rhetoric in preaching by some African Americans preachers over a course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries into American civil society. ^ Chapter 3 discusses a starting point for African American sacred rhetoric. Frederick Douglass is a primary figure in this chapter. His cultural background and discovery of the power of literacy, his worldview and intellectual development serve as a model for why some African Americans turned to rhetoric. For Douglass, forms of rhetoric served as a tool on the public platform and sacred pulpit. In his addresses and messages, Douglass used biblical passages and secular documents to argue for freedom. ^ Chapter 4 examines several preachers and practitioners of African American sacred rhetoric. Thirty sermons, speeches or articles were analyzed to substantiate these claims. These practitioners are Alexander Crummell, Francis J. Grimke, Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., and Mordecia W. Johnson, Joseph H. Jackson and Gardner C. Taylor. ^ This work contends that a civil integration was achieved because a segment of American culture embraced African American men of letters who used their pulpits and the public platform to persuade religiously and politically for achieving human uplift. This art form is best described as a form of civil discourse that persuades in public and sacred space for transforming socio-political and socio-economic aspects of society. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Historical / Archival|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Black Studies|History, Church|Theology|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Homiletic|African-American|Preaching|Sacred rhetoric|Western tradition","Chair","Daniel Akin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It sheds light on cultural similarities and differences between American and Arabic (Saudi) cultures in terms of persuasive written discourse. The data came from twenty six Arabic editorials of two distinguished Saudi newspapers, <italic>Alriyadh </italic> and <italic>Al-Jazirah</italic>, and another twenty six American editorials from the popular American newspapers, <italic>The New York Times </italic> and <italic>The Washington Post</italic>. This study employed Searle's (1976) taxonomy of speech acts as a coding system of speech acts. Its findings show that persuasiveness can be accomplished via different ways of manipulation of speech acts in different cultures. Although both American and Arabic editorials prefer the use of strong assertions, they seem to differ with regard to the speech acts of directives and expressives. The results indicate that American directives and expressives are stronger, and more direct and explicit than their Arabic counterparts. Accordingly, this study argues that whereas persuasion in American editorials is accomplished via powerful and explicit propositions, Arabic editorials favor the use of implied propositions persuade their readers. Arabic editorials approach their readers differently and hence try to accomplish persuasiveness while at the same time save their readers' face. Finally, the current research suggests that editorials in both cultures seem to have similar distributions of speech acts. However, differences are apparent in the way these speech acts are realized and manipulated. ^","Discourse or Text Analysis| ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Language, Linguistics|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Speech act|Arabic|Persuasion|Editorials|American","Major Professor","Victor Raskin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The primary goal is to create narrative accounts of three English instructors that illuminate the attitudes and the struggles they encounter when combining Synectics, a model of teaching, regularly into their own curriculum (Dewey 1915; Clandinin & Connelly 1992). The secondary goal is to examine the metaphorical language and the creative writing growth of students who use this model of learning. In addition, a comprehensive review of the literature relevant to the topic of Synectics is offered. ^ Three instructors' stories were used to shed light on the influences of Synectics (Gordon 1960; 1973) on student creative writing and teacher attitudes regarding the use of model. Using Melville's short story, ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" as a starting place for meaningful understanding (Bruner 2002), a narrative inquiry consisting of three forms of analysis: broadening, burrowing and restorying was undertaken to seek out teacher knowledge (Connelly & Clandinin, 1990). Using teacher reflection journals, semi-structured interviews and classroom observations, this study offered safe environments (Craig & Olson, 2001) for instructors from a college in South Texas, to retell and make meaning of those experiences (Bruner, 1986; Munby & Russell, 2001; Craig 2005). ^ Through the instructors' narratives, it was apparent that most students found the Synectics lessons enjoyable and began to use more metaphorical language in their brainstorming immediately after the lessons. However, this metaphorical language did not regularly appear in most of the students' formal essay assignments. ^ The lived stories also depicted the struggle each instructor underwent as they made Synectics part of their curriculum. As each instructor became more familiar with the model of teaching and used it more regularly, the lessons became more personalized to fit his or her own curriculum needs. Even so, the narratives suggest that time constraints, fears of criticism and rejection, and preconceived roles as curriculum implementers all contributed to instructors' opinions regarding Synectics. This inquiry raises future research questions concerning how students learn to apply metaphorical language in their formal essays and brings to light issues concerning how to encourage instructors to become curriculum makers instead of implementers. ^","Clinical / Case Study|Discourse or Text Analysis ~check","",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,2,"Literature, American|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Curriculum and Instruction","Bartleby syndrome|Teacher attitudes|Writing|Synectics","Adviser","Howard Jones",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research presented in this dissertation not only builds upon the work of scholars like David Bartholomae, Patricia Bizzell, and Kate Ronald, but it extends this work into the high school educational setting where relatively little serious research on composition pedagogy has previously been completed. ^ Using a grounded theory approach, qualitative research techniques developed by Anselm Strauss, to analyze and code participants' reflective writing, I discovered that they used complex conceptual metaphors of space as well as geographical concepts as a way of acquiring, extending, and refining their understanding of discourse communities and the manner in which such communities regulate and maintain language conventions. I also found that such approaches to composition instruction help students learn important rhetorical lessons including the importance of audience awareness and the role a writer's knowledge plays in writing credibly. ^ I also discovered the degree to which enacting critical or transformative pedagogies is uniquely problematic at the high school level. Participants in this study, despite the valuable insights they learned about writing, chose to defer these lessons to future writing tasks. In their reflective statements, participants indicated a feeling of powerlessness associated with their status as high school students when writing for certain discourse communities.

First, the ""text"" of the Enola Gay controversy exhibited persistent issues within America's cultural memory of the atomic bombing that takes a form of critical discourse and cultural struggle. In addition, the issues that emerged in the controversy have to do with problems of communicative acts performed within a specific institutional context; it was a discourse over a particular museum exhibit, not a speech or cinematography or televisual representation, that attempted to present a history of the atomic bombing. ^ This study addresses problematics of communication and rhetoric that the Enola Gay controversy exhibited.

Isocrates takes a number of seemingly conflicting positions on the capacity for rhetorical education to inculcate excellence in students. The dissertation attempts to sort out Isocrates' disparate positions on this question. I accomplish this by examining two of Isocrates' lesser known works titled <italic>To Nicocles</italic> and <italic>To Demonicus</italic>. Unlike Isocrates' more widely read texts like <italic>Areopagitucus</italic> or <italic>Antidosis</italic>, the gnomic texts are distinctive because they contain long lists of ethical maxims. I argue in the dissertation that these two texts can be read as a kind of literate technology designed to develop the memory of their readers. Unlike the modern conception of memory, the ancients tended to conceptualize the memory as a source of ethical invention as opposed to a place for the storage of information. This is significant because mnemonic-ethical texts like <italic>To Demonicus</italic> and <italic>To Nicocles</italic> lend support to the notion that the ancient rhetorical tradition was not simply an instrumental art designed to produce good speech. Instead, such texts demonstrate that the art of rhetoric sought to produce a kind of human being who could act appropriately when faced with contingent situations that could not be satisfied by the application of knowledge, theories, or normative rules. From this perspective, rhetoric becomes an ethical art designed to improve upon the student's capacity for action. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Philosophy of","Gnomic texts|Memory|Pedagogy|Maxims|Isocrates","Adviser","Michael C.

September 11 marks a day in American history that initiated one of the most significant shifts in public culture. American attitudes towards safety have become a centerpiece in our political and social interactions. Many Americans now live with the thought and fear of terrorism as a threat of considerable consequence. This project aims to investigate the rhetorical impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. More specifically, it will focus on the construction, dissemination, and the rhetorical functions of iconic images of terror in American society as they reflect 9/11. This analysis utilizes the theoretical framework provided by Lucaites and Hariman (2001) to begin to understand the extent to which images of terror play a role in the construction of a terror culture. This study proposes five critical implications for commemorative artifacts that serve to represent the experience of 9/11. First, Americans are drawn to iconic images as commemorative artifacts that represent the experience of 9/11. Second, the Twin Towers during the attacks have emerged as new iconic symbols of terrorism in the 21<super>st</super> century. Third, the images of the rescue worker and the American flag have taken on new meaning in light of the terror attacks. Fourth, narrative theory provides a useful tool for understanding the importance of iconic images as rhetorical symbols of 9/11. And finally, future studies in iconic imagery should extend their parameters to include categories of images rather than single images given recent advancements in media technology. ^","Cultural-Critical Studies|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Philosophical / Theoretical","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Speech Communication|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Rhetorical analysis|September 11, 2001|Culture|Iconic imagery|Terror","Adviser","Raymie McKerrow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Chapter One summarizes faculty responses to a ten-minute freewriting exercise, in which I asked respondents to describe or define proficient writing from the perspectives of their disciplines. In their responses, I locate four ""global characteristics"" used by a simple majority of respondents and 21 ""other characteristics"" used by at least one respondent. I argue that these characteristics, especially the global ones, constitute our College's local definition of proficiency. I close the chapter pointing out that future WAC workshops could include discussions of ""global"" and ""other characteristics"" locating them in student work, and discussing how to teach them, both in writing classes and elsewhere. Although the data in Chapter One are incomplete, they provide a starting place for a teacher-researcher who is interested in how colleagues across the campus describe writing. They also prompt questions about whether the respondents know what they are saying when they use terms like <italic>style, purpose, grammar</italic>, and <italic> audience</italic>. Do they really look for the characteristics they claimed to look for in their freewritings? Are there other characteristics to be added to the list? ^ Chapters Two and Three report and interpret additional data from the workshop. Each faculty member read and evaluated end of semester ENG 102 papers, rating them NP (nonproficient), P (proficient), or HP (highly proficient). These chapters are based on an unpublished study Dr. Tom Blues created at the University of Kentucky in May of 1993. Blues was ahead of his time by several years. In 1996, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) mandated an exit-exam for all students in ENG 102 and ENG 105 at Jefferson Community College. I show that a qualitative program assessment could complement or eventually replace the quantitative outside evaluation we are now using and conclude that in 1995 faculty in areas other than English often confused terms associated with writing, but generally returned to their freewriting definitions and descriptions throughout their evaluations. ^ Chapter Four summarizes my conclusions and recommendations, discusses the benefits of local, constructivist assessments in a culture that increasingly ""truncates and supplants genuine, holistic writing and undermines progress"" (Shafer 242). The chapter ends with practical recommendations mostly for my colleagues in the Writing Program at Jefferson Community College. Where do we go from here?

Despite their ease of use, these interfaces are neither transparent nor ideology-free (Selfe & Selfe, 1999). The drive to create user-friendly, easy-to-use software complicates pedagogy because, in many classrooms, instructors rely on such software applications without fully understanding or articulating to their students the implications of their use. Such uncritical use can lead students to develop a set of basic technological skills for composing Web documents but only as these technological skills are <italic>situated within </italic> and <italic>mediated</italic> by the specific interface.

It focuses on the different kinds and functions of the dialogic relationships students created for themselves when they participated in the study of literature and writing.

First, the study was to find whether writers with diverse educational backgrounds would perform the same written task differently. Second, it was designed to identify the macrostructure/rhetorical organization of research article (RA) introductions written in Arabic by Arab scholars. The third purpose was to explore differences and similarities between Arabic RA introductions and English RA introductions produced by Americans who were native speakers of English. The corpus used in this study consisted of 15 research article introductions divided into three groups: Arab-educated Arabs (A-Ed-A, authors who earned their graduate degrees in the Arab World), US-educated Arabs (US-Ed-A, authors who earned their degrees in the United States, and US-Native English speaking group (US-N). Swales's (1990) CARS model was used as a tool of analysis. Comparisons were made among the three groups at two levels of analysis: the macrostructure level and the move-step level. ^ The two Arabic groups were found different at the two levels of analysis: the macrostructure level and the move-step level. This result signified that there were two models of rhetorical organization of Arabic RA introductions: a homegrown model and a hybrid model. The homegrown exhibited features which were more distant from the US-N group than the US-Ed-A group which shared some US writing norms. In addition, both of the Arabic groups were different from their American counterpart. Arab authors claimed the importance of their research in the real world rather than in existing research tradition as was the case in the American group. Thus, educational background of Arab RA writers could account for the preference of the rhetorical organization model of RA introductions as the US-Ed-A writers employed a hybrid rhetorical organization and the A-Ed-A writers employed the homegrown model. In spite of the differences in the Arabic context, the norms of Arabic writing tolerate/embrace such diversity. ^","Discourse or Text Analysis| ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Language, Linguistics|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Research articles|Arabic|Contrastive rhetoric|English|Introductions","Adviser","Gene Halleck",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study starts from the premise that focusing on the <italic> organization</italic> of information can lead to data graphics that are potentially more useful. The study thus unites two sets of ideas: (a) means of organizing information, and (b) means of analyzing and presenting data in graphic form. ^ Six different ways of organizing information are developed in a framework that incorporates verbal, visual, and mathematical considerations. This framework, or heuristic, is then used to reveal underlying organizational structures present in data graphics. ^ Though theoretical in nature, the study focuses on the practical application of the concepts presented, such as how to use the organizational heuristic to design and evaluate data graphics. For example, the study explains two expert approaches to designing data graphics and then reformulates the experts' guidelines in line with the organizational heuristic. These reformulated guidelines are then used to compose knowledge-creating data graphics from unstructured data. ^ The study relies on document analysis as its research method. Documents dealing with organization issues include works from the field of information design and discourse theory by such authors as Richard Saul Wurman and James L. Kinneavy. Documents related to data graphics include works from the fields of statistics, operations research, and cartography by A. S. C. Ehrenberg, David Targett, and Jacques Bertin. ^ In exploring jointly two sets of ideas related to organization and data graphics, the study shows how data presentation, and the way data are organized, fosters data analysis and leads to the discovery of new information. For the field of composition and rhetoric, the study demonstrates in a concrete way the importance of rhetorical arrangement, and how rhetorical arrangement leads to rhetorical invention. The result is a pedagogical resource for composition and other writing instructors who want to integrate data graphics into their courses, or who seek a system of organizing that can be applied to text as well as to data graphics. ^","Model-Building ~Read|Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Business Administration, General|Journalism|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Visual communication|Data graphics|Business communication|Technical communication|Writing instructors","Adviser","Bennett A.

I explore the ways in which the rhetoric of multiculturalism critiques and challenges dominant narratives about the civil society by-products of citizenship, civic virtues, and the common good. I then show how multiculturalists reconceptualize the U.S. social sector to achieve the promises of democracy. My central thesis is that the different forms of multiculturalism working synergistically provide a theoretical model and normative ideal of U.S. civil society based on a philosophical tradition of pluralistic egalitarianism. An underlining thesis of this work is that democracy needs and is needed by a moral philosophy of pluralistic egalitarianism. Together they keep the ideal of democracy possible. ^ I begin the analysis by examining how the different forms of multiculturalism reconceptualize the U.S. citizen. The pluralistic egalitarian citizen considers the moral and political principles of equality, freedom, justice, and humanity a set of ultimate norms that guide critical thinking about divisive issues in U.S. society. Chapter three illustrates how multicultural rhetoric transforms traditional notions of civic virtues by rejecting the disjunction between principles and virtues. Pluralistic egalitarian members of society live by civic moral virtues that express the contractarian principles of democracy in their public and private lives. Chapter four examines how multiculturalism challenges pervasive ideologies in current U.S. society that obstruct the realization of the ideal of democracy and creates a space in which members of society who hold divergent ideas of the common good can come together and deliberate in an ethical manner. In chapter five, I examine the agentic orientations that academic multiculturalists adopt and the multicultural literacy that they create in pursuit of their transformational goals. Chapter six applies the moral framework of pluralistic egalitarianism to two examples of divisive contemporary issues in U.S. society---unauthorized Mexican workers and homosexual rights---illustrating how multiculturalists offer ways to communicate about cultural issues and mitigate cultural tensions that extend the ideal of democracy to all its members. Chapter seven concludes the study with a discussion of limitations and illumination of possibilities. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical ~check|Cultural-Critical Studies ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Society|Reconceptualizing|Pluralistic|Multiculturalism|Twenty-first century|Rhetoric|Egalitarian","Adviser","Stephen Souris",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the 1960s and '70s, writing teachers turned to the popular culture studies movement for content and methods. From the late 1970s on, however, compositionists have been increasingly influenced by cultural studies in the Birmingham tradition. Throughout the late '80s and '90s, cultural studies approaches dominated the study of popular culture in composition; these approaches have benefited writing instruction, but they have had problematic results as well. We can overcome the weaknesses of cultural studies pedagogies and develop more effective writing curricula by reclaiming useful elements of popular culture studies and grounding our appropriations from both movements in established theories and methods from rhetoric and composition studies. ^ This dissertation delineates historical, theoretical, political, and practical similarities and differences between cultural studies and popular culture studies and traces how these fields have influenced composition studies.

Scaffolding, a type of interaction associated with the novice-expert role dyad, is considered to be among the most widely used pedagogical strategies in composition instruction. Data were gathered during a single semester's freshman composition course and included audio recordings of conferences, conference observation field notes, and post-conference interviews with student participants. Features described as possible by current literature in composition studies were synthesized into operational categories and compared with transcriptions of actual teacher-student writing conference interactions. ^ The transcripts of actual conferences revealed that scaffolding as described in current literature was not a pervasive type of interaction during teacher-student writing conferences. Many of the features of scaffolding described by the literature were evident, but the potential for scaffolding during the interactions was hampered by limited student contribution to dialogue, missed opportunities at critical decision points, and the inability to discern student demonstration of comprehension or increased competence as a result of the interaction. ^ The transcripts revealed a student preference for directive instruction, a recognition of the teacher's authority, and a hesitance to question authority that are characteristic of the developmental stage associated with college freshmen.

Data yielded from interview and group session transcripts and survey responses indicated that (a) general teaching anxiety triggers (that is, triggers found in any discipline and at any level) are often compounded by discipline- and/or program-specific anxiety triggers, (b) the potential anxiety triggers instructors reported or exhibited seem to interfere with their abilities to successfully impart student learning, and (c) instructors' behavioral responses to such anxiety triggers are influenced by what they consider to be the likeliest and/or most addressable sources of their anxiety. These findings provide several starting points for a much needed in-depth look into the causes and manifestations of and possible remedies for teaching anxiety as well as the long-term effects of teacher preparation and faculty development programs on anxiety and job performance. ^","Clinical / Case Study|Survey ~check","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Educational Psychology|Education, Teacher Training|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Teaching anxiety|Communication apprehension|Composition Studies|Anxiety triggers","Advisers","Kristine Blair; Sue Carter Wood",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Even though the growing discipline of professional and technical communication has begun to focus on the discourse practices of engineers, technical communication scholarship has produced only research and pedagogy that is attentive to audience awareness. My research instead shows the ways that rhetoric is embedded in all engineering activities. I develop a rhetoric of engineering that I define as an iterative, recursive, and epistemic process, and claim the communications and discourse required for a successful engineering project are rhetorical. Recursion promotes revision to engineering documentation and compels engineers to reassess their world view of a project. That is, rhetorical engineering can actually prevent solipsistic engineering practices common in all of the major disciplines. The rhetoric of engineering's recursivity spawns multiple iterations or versions of the texts necessary for a successful project. These iterations effectively create an archive for an engineering project that serves as an external memory device for an engineering team. Chapter one contains a rhetorical analysis of software requirement specifications for a professionally developed software application from the medical industry. I demonstrate how the text from this pre-engineering design document becomes embedded in the final material product that is the saleable software application. In chapter two I adapt Aristotle's special topics to serve an engineering audience. I apply my new special topics of engineering to real-life engineering situations provided in the form of profiles that document a calendar day of a working engineer. I critique the major textbooks used to teach engineers communication skills in chapter three and propose my own curriculum in chapter four. I believe that the challenges of interdepartmental collaboration necessitated by English writing instructors teaching engineering students provides an important site for theoretical and pedagogical innovation. My findings make an important contribution to the ongoing debate about the nature, definition, and role of technical communication and about appropriate instructional methodologies for teaching engineers communication. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Critical / Hermeneutical|Poetic / Fictive ~check|Clinical / Case Study ~check","",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,1,3,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Engineering|Teaching|Rhetoric|Professional writing|Technical communication","Adviser","Todd Oakley",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study probes the complexity of assigning <italic>value</italic> to various characteristics of writing in the field of urban planning and architecture. The major question is: can performance-oriented writing descriptors be determined and described from the communication strategies of successful architects and planners? If so, these descriptors can be used to develop desired learning outcomes in the academic training of college students comparable to the way that elementary and secondary teachers work with the characteristics known as the Six-Traits (ideas, conventions, organization, sentence fluency, word choice, and voice). ^ The first step in the study was to procure a representative sampling of eight text-based pieces from such genres as project narratives, city council resolutions, executive summaries, public brochures, and planning documents. A cohort of eleven professionals scored the papers on the quality of writing and each provided a minimum of seven descriptive terms. They defined the terms and also wrote a paragraph telling what they considered to be good writing in urban planning and architecture. ^ The second step was to condense the descriptors provided by cohort 1 into a survey to be distributed on the listserv of the American Planning Association. Cohort 2 was made up of the 150 respondents who prioritized the descriptors and offered additional comments. A third, smaller cohort of seven individuals representing a cross-section of the professions, was asked to react to the choices and to respond more fully to qualitative interview questions. ^ The key descriptors that emerged from a factor analysis, supported by the qualitative analysis, fell into these domains: coherence and topicality, which enable planners and architects to move communities collectively to a vision; voice must be active and provocative, yet is factual but brief; rhythm and tone build coherency and clarity, but are not the end result; ideas and facts must be marked by precise words, definitions and fluency; and the intent must be clear without subversive assumptions. ^","Survey|Model-Building ~check|Interview / Focus Group","",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Curriculum and Instruction|Urban and Regional Planning","Urban planning|Performance-oriented writing descriptors|Architecture|Writing|Rubric","Adviser","James Blasingame",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Q-methodology's greatest advantage is that it allows participants to model their own subjective viewpoints on the issue at hand, rather than being subjected to and defined by the researcher's pre-determined categories.

In general, I suggest that this connection served as a rhetorical solution to academic anxieties regarding the relationship between theory production and political intervention. By reading across a range of discourses---key queer theory texts; queer activists' manifestoes, flyers, and advertisements; media coverage of queer activism; and the speeches and editorials of a controversial conservative gay spokesperson---I emphasize the politics of rhetorical form in order to retheorize rhetorical agency. I contend that the formal features of a text enable it to be socially recognizable, and thereby both produce and constrain its force and effects. Furthermore, unlike previous authors who have addressed the political agency of queer subjects and who have defined queerness in terms of its resistant potential, I posit queerness as the general economy of undecidability from which agency emerges. Following an introduction, in Chapter Two I present a critical genealogy of the proliferation of queer theory and consider the ways in which its disciplinary positioning is related to the agency of academic institutions. In Chapter Three I examine the polemical speeches and articles of Larry Kramer, arguing ultimately that the polemic is a provocative---and potentially queer---rhetorical form. In Chapter Four I turn to Queer Nation, and suggest that the document which is often read as a manifesto for the group's purpose illustrates the limits of rhetorical agency. Finally, Chapter Five concentrates on the Lesbian Avengers, whose use of humor enabled them to be taken up by the mainstream media, and who demonstrate the entailments of queer theory's penchant for visibility politics. Overall, as I explain in my concluding chapter, this project intervenes within both rhetorical studies and queer theory; not only does it join the burgeoning conversation regarding rhetorical agency and resistance, but it also offers a meta-commentary on the relatively ignored disciplinary mechanisms through which queer theory has gained its institutional force. ^","Historical / Archival|Rhetorical Analysis|Critical / Hermeneutical|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Speech Communication|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Gender Studies","Activism|Rhetorical agency|Resistance|Queer","Adviser","Barbara A.

Though writing has been variously characterized by researchers ill do fields of composition and literacy, many, even those espousing cognitive theories of writing, have overlooked writing's potential to constitute consciousness. ^ Drawing primarily on insights from cognitive science, cognitive linguistics, and literary theory, this study characterizes writing as the act of capturing the multidimensional feel of sapient awareness in do serial medium of text. Comparisons between writing and other representational media, most especially pictorial art, demonstrate the capacity of sophisticated, or metacognitive, text to capture this multidimensional experience, much as a picture in perspective both captures and improves upon visual experience. ^ This investigation posits that the metacognitive writer layers object and metalanguages to represent in textual space the relationships among languaged thoughts in mental space. The metacognitive writer takes a perspective on the propositional content of the text and encodes the relative psychic distance between the perspective point and the content by using textual maneuvers analogous to shading and occlusion in pictorial art.

For decades, that term has been used to symbolize the ubiquity and significance of baseball in American life. Too often, this symbolism has been reduced to claims of American exceptionalism, with baseball serving as an exemplar of the liberal democratic state. This dissertation is a critical engagement with baseball as a rhetorical phenomenon, specifically with attention to its role in the reconstitution of American identity following terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. ^ The study is framed by a discussion that links the development of the national pastime to a Christian tradition in the United States. From there, it examines ritual performances at baseball games, a traveling museum exhibit sponsored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, the recent debate about the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and the return of Major League Baseball to Washington, D.C. in 2005. Together, these rhetorical performances have contributed to a collective ritual of purification that has characterized U.S. culture following 9/11. As an exemplar of innocence and purity, the national pastime has been upheld as a healthy diversion for American citizens, a symbol of national unity, and a model institution of democratic inclusion. In spite of such rhetoric, however, baseball has been complicit in the rhetorical construction of a world defined by good and evil, and has thus provided substantial support to President George W. Bush in his ""war on terrorism."" ^ The goal of this dissertation is to complicate the metaphor of baseball as America, and to reconstitute it in more humble, democratic terms. This requires a critique of the discourses of both baseball and U.S. foreign policy. It demands that readers, spectators, and citizens acknowledge their roles in the construction of a world in which Americans define their adversaries in problematic and destructive ways. Furthermore, it is an invitation to recover a more active and critical sense of judgment, insisting that the only way to foster our democracy is to speak and act democratically. In short, this study envisions an American political culture in which diversity is valued and democratic contestation encouraged. ^","Historical / Archival|Cultural-Critical Studies ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"American Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Foreign policy|September 11, 2001|National pastime|Baseball|Rhetorical purification","Adviser","Robert L.

In this study I analyze a series of Illinois court decisions in the midst of this shift, in order to better understand two interrelated concerns. First, how does the rhetoric of law work, and how, in particular, is legal change justified? Second, how does law interact with culture? ^ I argue that rhetoric works simultaneously at two different levels. First, it works through large scale patterns of discourse, such as the organizing family/government metaphor. This type of language helps structure what is common sense, and, in doing so, shapes accepted patterns of reasoning. Second, legal rhetoric works through the use of specific rhetorical devices. These specific rhetorical devices help to explain how individual judges negotiate legal constraints and justify their decisions. I explicate how form and precedent in particular are powerful rhetorical devices that are often not even recognized as being rhetorical. Their rhetoricity becomes apparent when they deviate from the norm and work as an active force in changing law. The overarching commonality between form and precedent as rhetorical devices is that, first, they both work, in different ways, to create expectations where certain conclusions <italic> appear</italic> natural and inevitable, thus shifting standards of proof. Second, each entails rhetorical invention; they are persuasive choices.^ On each of these levels, legal rhetoric works in a hermeneutic encounter with rhetorical culture.

In other words, these child custody decisions cannot be adequately interpreted without recognition of how they fit within the larger cultural context of gender norms and expectations.

Results suggest that participants used interconnecting spatial, social, and discursive techniques to construct familiarity and comfort in campus and writing environments, making explicit the relationships between spatial awareness, rhetorical strategies, and composing practices. These relationships have been previously theorized upon but have not resulted in in-depth qualitative accounts of pedagogical experiences. This study of spatial, rhetorical, and pedagogical theories and methods explores these relationships using the critical lenses of cultural geography and spatial composition as reflected through maps, tables, photos, artifacts, and participant interviews and essays. What can students in a writing class gain from a more critical understanding of space and place? What can instructors gain from a spatial analysis of their own practices? Are there similar strategies to how student writers approach unfamiliar spaces, texts, and assignments? What pedagogical practices can help students critique their spatial experiences and their writing skills? Can grounded theory be utilized to analyze and interpret the experiences of instructors and students in place-based composition class? Utilizing extensive student contributions and feedback in which participants informed all stages of the research process, this study suggests that the connections between spatial conditions, social relationships, and the practices of writing be experienced as multiple, mutually constitutive, and always involved in how writers locate, position, and situate themselves in writing spaces, classroom spaces, and textual spaces. The theory put forward by this dissertation proposes that space and physicality are crucial parts of the writing process and composition pedagogy, and spatial awareness and qualitative research can be used to help students become more informed writers and composition instructors more informed teachers. This theory also argues that including more critical views of space and place could enhance present interests and movements in composition such as visual rhetoric and public writing. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research|Ethnographic|Model-Building|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Cultural geography|Place-based|First-year writing|Pedagogy|Space","Adviser","Nedra Reynolds",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

At the core of the conflict among members of the Skull Valley Goshute tribe over the storing of nuclear waste on their reservation are issues of political, cultural, and environmental identity. In the following chapters, guided by literature from various academic fields and Paul Ricoeur's theory of narrated identity, I conduct a content analysis of various narratives from tribal members regarding the storing of nuclear waste on their reservation. I conclude that both political and cultural identity are constructed, maintained, and negotiated through narratives about nuclear waste and are articulated in such a manner as to create a direct connection with the natural world. The environment becomes more than just a context for political and cultural conflict: it constitutes the conflict itself, and identity narratives become the means by which conflict about the nuclear waste gets constructed and reconstructed. Likewise, the environmental controversy becomes the conduit by which identity is allowed to evolve, change, and become modified through narrative creating a complex milieu for tribal policy development and decision making. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Rhetorical Analysis ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Speech Communication|Political Science, Public Administration|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Native American Studies","Nuclear waste|Energy policy|Native American|Identity|Controversy|Skull Valley Goshute Reservation|Utah|Environmental policy","Adviser","Christine Oravec",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Digital technologies produce and call attention to economic inequalities via the very same means by which they increase economic productivity---by substituting capital-intensive processes for labor-intensive processes---but composition has largely failed to address those inequalities in economic terms. Instead, composition's pedagogies have reduced economy to culture and student social class to pedagogical exigency. This dissertation offers a categorical analysis of the one way in which composition does explicitly address economic issues: by constructing them as class. However, even in its various engagements with class, composition's theoretical constructions of class habitually posit the remediation of inequality as a cultural rather than economic concern. The work of Raymond Williams, Pierre Bourdieu, and J. K. Gibson-Graham offers the foundations for an alternative theory of class that maintains a useful focus on economic concerns while not denying the cultural. After constructing this theory, this dissertation applies it to the composition classroom in order to examine the economic nature and value of student work, particularly in terms of the production and digital reproduction of student writing. The dissertation's final portion connects recent scholarship on the value of affect and immaterial labor to the ideas of legal scholar Lawrence Lessig and the open source movement today often associated with digital technologies of reproduction in order to posit an alternative theory of value for student writing, and the implications of such a theory for composition pedagogy in general. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Composition classroom|Economic activity|Value|Information economy|Class","Adviser","Donna LeCourt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Or a pay-at-the-pump gas station? Or an airline e-ticket kiosk? How did you know what to do? Although you never received any formal instruction in how to interact with the self-service technology, you were likely able to accomplish your task (e.g., withdrawing or depositing money) as successfully as an experienced user. However, not so long ago, to accomplish that same task, you needed the direct mediation of a service professional who had been trained how to use the required complex technology. What has changed? In short, the technology is now able to compensate for the average consumer's lack of experience with the transactional system. ^ The technology itself bridges the performance gap, allowing a novice to accomplish the same task as an experienced professional. This shift to a self-service paradigm is completely changing the dynamics of the consumer relationship with the capitalist enterprise, resulting in what is rapidly becoming the default consumer interface of the postmodern era. The recognition that the entire performance support apparatus now revolves around the end user/consumer rather than the employee represents a tectonic shift in the workforce training industry. ^ What emerges is a homogenized consumer culture enabled by self-service technologies---a kiosk culture. No longer is the ability to interact with complex technology confined to a privileged workforce minority who has access to expensive and time-consuming training. The growth of the kiosk culture is being driven equally by business financial pressures, consumer demand for more efficient transactions, and the improved sophistication of compensatory technology that allows a novice to perform a task with the same competence as an expert. ^ ""The Kiosk Culture"" examines all aspects of self-service technology and its ascendancy. Beyond the milieu of business, the kiosk culture is also infiltrating all corners of society, including medicine, athletics, and the arts, forcing us to re-examine our definitions of knowledge, skills, performance, and even humanity. The current ubiquity of self-service technology has already impacted our society and will continue to do so as we ride the rising tide of the kiosk culture.^","Philosophical / Theoretical ~flag|Historical / Archival ~check","Cultural anthropology -- how to tag?",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"American Studies|Anthropology, Cultural|Education, Adult and Continuing|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Mass Communications","Kiosk culture|Age of machines|Postmodern|Performance support","Adviser","Karla Saari Kitalong",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The project outlines a conceptual framework of cultural, critical, and pedagogical consciousness for radical teaching in composition. The project analyzes student responses to courses that ask students to discuss and write on topics that they may see as ""controversial"" or ""too political."" Through case studies, the project addresses whether or not student expectations for writing instruction, as illustrated in a Women and Writing course, can be reconciled with a teacher's desire to teach writing as a political and social act. To teach writing in such a way requires greater understanding of students' backgrounds, self-perceived identities, and educational desires. The author terms this understanding ""cultural consciousness.'' Cultural consciousness is complemented by pedagogical consciousness---a constant, self reflexive reevaluation of one's radical teaching practices. Faced with the possibility that radical teaching is incompatible with composition instruction, the study suggests that it need not be if radical composition teachers negotiate between the expectations of their practice and the practical writing concerns of their students. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research|Clinical / Case Study|Cultural-Critical Studies ~check","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Pedagogical|Critical culture|Radical pedagogy|Consciousness|Writing|Feminist pedagogy","Adviser","Sherrie Gradin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of the study was to elicit the criteria and standards of assessment that guided the instructor's readings of the documents created by students for a visual rhetoric assignment. A set of interviews conducted at the beginning and end of the semester provided the data for analysis. A traditional grounded method of qualitative analysis was combined with a network textual analysis to understand the individual instructor accounts of their experience evaluating the student works. ^ The analysis of the instructor accounts reveals three kinds of closely related problems inherent in the assessment of multimodality. First, there is a problem associated with the use of conventional criteria of texts, such as clarity or coherence, when instructors attempt to apply those to visuals. Secondly, there is a problem associated with the instructors attempt to describe the inter-dynamic relationship between the textual mode and the visual mode. These problems are related by a term, ''linkage,'' which is defined as containing material, technical, and theoretical aspects. Finally, there is a problem in the actual assessment of the projects that seems to be a consequence of the multiplicity of meaning available in the complex compositions. The instructors seem to abandon a criterion motivated assessment in favor of a more holistic procedure that relies upon implicit standards of rhetorical affect or creative or aesthetic qualities.

Specifically, I was curious about the ways that formative evaluation, that is, teacher commentary provided during the drafting stage of the writing process, affected students during their writing processes from a cognitive, emotive, and behavioral perspective. In other words, I was asking if students: (1) understood teacher comments as they were intended; (2) whether certain comments evoked positive or negative emotion in students; (3) based on the comments provided did students choose to revise; and (4) if students did choose to revise, why did they do so and in what way? ^ Questions concerning the way teacher commentary affects students are important ones to ask because the ways that students are affected by feedback can also affect their perception of their abilities and their willingness to perform a task in the future. Equally of import is questioning the way a student comes to the teacher's text. Social psychologists suggest that one's state of mind upon receiving feedback inform the ways in which the feedback received. And finally, it is believed that isolated demographic populations, thanks to the stimuli and mores of their particular era and environment, may react to feedback from authority figures in surprising but similar ways. ^ My research uncovers that students' self-efficacy and perceived locus of control, both tenets of social and cognitive psychology, indeed influence the way that they perceive teacher commentary and the way that they respond behaviorally through revision practices. I also suggest that contemporary students, deluged by media and entertainment, may not be responsive to teacher commentary, especially when it is perceived as negative in ways that writing teachers might not anticipate.^","Clinical / Case Study ~check|Survey ~check","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Self-efficacy|Social attitudes|Teacher commentary|Composition students|Locus of control","Adviser","Roxanne Mountford",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most writing teachers recognize that both writing and teaching are ""complicated,"" but how does that knowledge inform our teaching? Drawing on complexity theory, cybernetics and composition, I argue that for the most part we have approached the issue in the wrong way. We seek, like business mangers, to treat complexity as a problem to be reduced. We isolate key features of writing and manage by exception. We divide up the work of writing in classes so that we can demonstrate students' coverage of skills and use outcome tests to discern how effecting our teaching has been. In Part I of my dissertation, ""The Writing Factory,"" I explain the origins of such an approach in technocratic rationality, as well as offering an explanation as to why some of our most rigorous efforts of this kind have failed us. Part II, ""The Writing Ecology"" focuses on an alternative way to understand writing via complexity theory. Here complexity refers to how multitudes of agents simultaneously act upon one another in order to create emergent phenomena. Neural networks, insect colonies, and ecosystems all operate in this fashion, and, as Margaret Syverson argues, so do writers. Like Syverson, I explore concepts of emergent, enactive, and distributed cognition and how they relate to writing. Where Syverson argues primarily for new directions in research, however, I look at how complexity theory builds upon prior debates in composition. I explore Syverson's own driving metaphor of an ""ecology of writing"" through prior works in composition, particularly those of Wendy Bishop, Marilyn Cooper and David Barton. I also look at classrooms designed by Derrick Owens, Michael Blitz and Mark Hurlbert that best represent how teachers and students have learned not only to cope with complexity, but to live with it creatively. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Distributed cognition|Writing classroom|Enactive cognition|Emergent cognition|Complexity","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In that vein, this project looks back at history to see how people before responded to similar literacy crises and uses their responses to help us ethically proceed during this current climate of educational and economic crisis. ^ Through ethnography, this project tells the stories of Italian immigrants who sought entry into the United State_Ê_s booming industrial economy and were falsely told that English-language literacy was a necessity for employment and cultural acceptance. By exploring Italy_Ê_s history, educational structure, and the impact of WWII on the participants_Ê_ literacy practices, the first part of the dissertation focuses on the education these immigrants brought with them, showing that literacy sponsorship is not always economically determined nor sought for social mobility. Analyzing popular rhetoric regarding the arrival of Italian immigrants, the second section focuses on the creation and perpetuation of the literacy myth and its ethnocentric underpinnings. The third section compares the adult education programs created for immigrants within Cleveland, OH with the participants_Ê_ accounts of their development of literacy skills and strategies within the same city, revealing that most of the immigrants learning took place within their own community, rather than in the schools. Further, it illustrates that the participants limited use of the English language did not exempt them from social mobility nor stem from ignorance or false consciousness, but was an act of cultural resistance. The final section uses the conclusions drawn in previous chapters to call for composition and rhetoric scholars to engage in working class issues through activist ethnographic research, rhetorical analyses of claims of literacy crises and portrayals of the working class as illiterate, and the development of ethical pedagogical strategies for adult learners.^","Ethnographic|Cultural-Critical Studies|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Education, Adult and Continuing|Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Immigrants|Italian-Americans|Working class|Literacies|War","Adviser","Charlotte Hogg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The course comprised of three units that taught the genres of announcements, cover letters and argumentative texts to 14 ESL students, who were mainly from Asia and from Central America. ^ To investigate their development of theoretical thinking, students_Ê_ models of genre, their answers to problem-solving tasks, and their answers to the problem situation question of the course were analyzed. Out of the 14 students who had their theoretical thinking investigated, 6 students had their pre-tests and post-tests on cover letters and argumentative texts analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The qualitative analysis focused on the moves performed by the students while the quantitative analysis ran the Wilcoxon Ranks Test in the scores assigned by raters to the tests. The meaning-making process of the 14 students were grasped by the content analysis of the logs they kept during the course. The instructor asked them to comment about what they learned and their impressions about the course. ^ The analyses of the data indicate that: (a) students thought mainly empirically and occasionally revealed some signs of theoretical thinking; (b) the students significantly improved in writing cover letters but not argumentative texts; (c) overall students improved in some aspect or another in both genres but most of them did not abandon the five-paragraph format; (d) most of the students did not actively engage in making sense of the course and when they did so, their perceptions were highly affected by their past educational experiences. ^ This dissertation highlights the need for education to focus more on the development of theoretical thinking and to engage students in more meaningful meaning-making processes, where they could engage actively in dealing with the dialectical relationship of personal senses and external meanings.

The dissertation offers an overview of what an author might expect to encounter between the inspirational moment an idea occurs to her to the day her manuscript arrives at a publishing house. The dissertation research is supported with examples of practical application. ^ The authoring process begins with market research. For this one needs to know her audience-the young child. The dissertation explains the importance of studying child psychology and understanding the developmental stages of childhood. Writing a board book for a one-year old is different from writing a poem for a four-year old. The young child is a keen observer and a vicious critic. If an author is ignorant as to the needs of her audience, no ideas will ever become books. Agents and publishers are professionals at spotting an author who has not done her homework, who is an amateur. ^ Another aspect of market research is to be aware of what is currently being published. Books you see in libraries and bookstores are manuscripts publishers have accepted. Not only does an author want to know what is currently on shelves, but to study the classics. Studying the classics provides a foundation for writing. Understanding what has been written for children in the past that has been considered the finest in writing and illustrating is a prerequisite for any serious author of children's literature. The classics reveal the finest in storytelling. ^ This dissertation examines the scholarly work of Joseph Campbell on the theme of the monomyth-the one story told by all humans through all the ages. Understanding the roots of storytelling offers the author a platform from which she may begin to weave her own creative stories for her young audience knowing that the elements of heroes and quests and happy returns are all integral to the child's life. In this manner this research examines how books may nurture childhood needs. ^ The dissertation provides a rationale of why aspiring authors need to stay abreast of contemporary cultural issues facing today's youth, and explains the necessity of embracing the diversity of today's multicultural audience. This aspect is both market research and a way to know ones audience. ^ Writing and networking go hand in hand. The authoring-publishing process involves authors realizing the benefits of seminars, conferences, writing groups, and making personal contacts in the book industry. Once an author has produced a manuscript there are specific rules and regulations for submitting work and every agent or publisher has their own way of doing business. The dissertation explains that it is the author's responsibility to know submission etiquette of each prospective publishing company. Within this dissertation, one could find direction as well as real-world examples of how to take an idea for a children's book, create a manuscript, and know how to approach the publishing world. ^","Practitioner / Teacher Research ~wait, what?|Model-Building ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Education, Early Childhood|Education, Elementary|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Curriculum and Instruction","Children's literature|Authoring|Publishing","Adviser","Joan Scanlon McMath",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This dissertation project, situated in the field of digital rhetoric, aims to develop methodologies for research in digital rhetoric: these new methods are needed because current research methods are grounded in print-based literacies. Researching digital rhetorics and digital literacies requires an epistemological shift in focus that is not easily supported by current methods. For this project I have built a web-based tool that applies digital analytics to digital work, rather than relying on the application of analog (print-based) methods. One of the key affordances of networked communication is that work can circulate through increasingly widespread knowledge ecologies; the initial object of analysis for the digital methods I am developing is the role of circulation within the rhetorical practices of digital production, using a baseline case study that traces and visualizes the circulation, citation, and use of published online scholarship from <italic>Kairos</italic> and the <italic>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</italic>, followed by a series of case studies that evaluate how writers may deploy and apply these methods to their online portfolios of work. ^ The aim of this dissertation is twofold: to articulate a theory of digital rhetoric that features circulation as a foundational element that effects each of the five classical canons of rhetoric (invention, organization, style, memory, delivery) and to develop both methodology and methods for tracing the circulation of rhetorical objects across and through various knowledge domains and networks. This methodology is supported by a theoretical foundation that sees circulation as a rhetorical activity that takes place within and across multiple ecologies and that is driven by economic functions particular to digital production. A key element of this methodology is understanding how to build digital systems whose function is to make visible the connections described by the theoretical framework; additionally, I argue that creating and documenting such systems is itself part of the methodology and not simply a tool whose use supports the activities of inquiry. ^","Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography ~Read|Model-Building|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check|Survey ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Mass Communications","Circulation|Social capital|Internet research|Digital rhetorics|Knowledge economy","Adviser","James E.

Instead, it is an Aristotelian triangle which consists of <italic>logos</italic> (logic), <italic>ethos</italic> (credibility), and <italic>pathos</italic> (emotion). As the Legal Realists first noted, logic by itself often cannot determine the result of the proceedings because each party to a dispute finds rational arguments to support its position and thus the competing theories face a logical stalemate. Judges who adopt a dogmatic tone belie this indeterminacy. Instead, the factor which enables one party to prevail over another is the <italic>ethos</italic> of one or more of the speakers or writers in the matter. <italic>Ethos</italic> is established in many different ways, such as by providing consistent testimony at trial or by relying on precedent during the appeal.

Analysis of the spoken and written aspects of both the trial and the appeal of this case demonstrates that trials produce an interpretation of events that is deemed ""true"" regardless of other plausible readings of the facts. This truth is a very specific one that applies retrospectively to the facts of the matter and affects only the parties involved in the dispute at hand. By contrast, appeals develop a generalized notion of the truth that is prospective and affects not just the original litigants but also future unrelated parties.

More specifically, the method comprises a digital storytelling and knowledge management tool that allows one or more users to create, save, store, and visually map or model digital stories. The method creates a digital network of a community's stories for digital ethnography work. Digital patches that represent the gateway to the stories of an individual are pieced together into a larger quilt design, creating a visual space that yields the voices of its creators at the click of a mouse. Through this narrative mapping, users are able to deal with complexity, ambiguity, density, and information overload. The method takes the traditional quilt use and appropriates it into a digital apparatus so that the user is connected to multiple points of view that can be dynamically tried out and compared. ^ The hypertextual quilting method fulfills the definition of a deconstructive hypertext and emancipatory social science research methodologies by creating a collaborative, polyvocal interface where users have access to the code, content and conduits to rewrite culture's history with subaltern voices.

This exploratory mixed methods study investigated bilingual teachers' perceptions of voice in the writing of bilingual children, specifically when comparing teacher ratings of children's writing on an informal writing assessment. ^ Both qualitative and quantitative results showed similar findings. Quantitative findings suggest that native English bilingual teachers scored voice higher than native Spanish bilingual teachers. Native Spanish bilingual teachers scored Spanish writing samples more severely than native English teachers. These results inform us that the two groups of teachers see voice differently from each other. In addition, key findings in the qualitative section suggest that voice was: (a) an essential component of writing; (b) influenced by both teachers' and students' culture; and (c) influenced by <italic> who</italic> was the reader, among other factors. ^ The results of this research study add to the limited body of published literature on bilingual children's writing in first and second language, specifically on the trait of voice. It is hoped that results of this study will open a new window for researchers, practitioners, and administrators in the field of bilingual education and education in general to bring about positive changes in practices for assessing and teaching writing to bilingual children.

In particular, I investigated the relationship between the teaching and learning environment and the students' interpretations, the students' understanding of the composition program their assignments were a part of, and how their orientation toward the program evolved over time. This study was predicated on the belief that the way in which literacy is used within any classroom community is not given but is constructed by its members and continuously evolves. Each classroom represents a community of practice mediating the discourse of the class and the discourses of the students even while it is affected by the attitudes, beliefs, values, and experiences those students bring into the classroom with them. The results of this study show that as students work to make meaning from the writing assignments they encounter, they may call into play the repertoire (the resources for negotiating meaning) that exist as part and parcel of the classroom writing experience. The students involved in this study described what they saw as the overall theme of their English 102 course in terms of different literacies, and when asked to explain their writing assignments individually, they clearly understood them in terms of Street's ideological model of literacy, which views literacy as a social practice and not simply as a technical and neutral skill. While the writing assignment prompts did include references to literacy, they did not include information about literacy that could explain the depth of understanding the students exhibited. It should also be noted that the students were not asked to describe what they had learned about literacy, but what they thought the writing assignment was asking them to do and what they felt their instructors were looking for in their responses. This study gives evidence that students do make use of various discourses as they work to interpret and make sense of the writing assignments they encounter. This was evident both in the students' discussions of the individual writing assignments and in their discussions of the course as a whole.^","Practitioner / Teacher Research ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Communities of practice|Literacy|First-year composition|Writing assignments|Assignments","Adviser","Shannon Carter",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies have shown this assignment to be popular with instructors because of the reflection it is thought to generate; however, nobody has yet looked at what instructors really mean by <italic> reflection</italic>. This study investigates what features of student texts instructors recognize as reflection. I collected literacy narratives and demographic questionnaires from students and surveys, assignments, think-clouds, and follow-up interviews from instructors. ^ Personal writing, and the literacy narrative assignment in particular, can best be taught by highlighting the rhetorical capabilities of this genre. The results of the think-alouds show that instructors most often consider analytical moves, such as cause-effect and evaluation, as reflection. This emphasis on cause-effect and evaluation arguments demonstrates that the focus of instructor assignments on description and other narrative elements is perhaps misdirected. Two other features also carried cultural capital with instructors but to a lesser extent than argumentative moves: literary elements, including vivid description and metaphoric language, and appeals to shared values. Instructors were more likely to flesh out the connections for students when value-appeals were present, particularly ones that promote middle-class perspectives. This finding is problematic because students from more privileged socioeconomic and educational backgrounds seemed more able to invoke these shared values, which thus suggests that working-class students' texts were seen as less reflective, and hence, were less successful in fulfilling the goals of the assignment. These results lend some empirical support to claims that the literacy narrative assignment reinforces middle-class perspectives; as such, it may not be as beneficial for marginalized groups of students as advocates of personal writing have asserted. This research suggests educators should be more aware of class assumptions that may influence how they respond to student writing. ^ I conclude by presenting recommendations on how writing instructors can more effectively teach literacy narratives, including more clearly articulating their goals for the assignment and how they will assess these goals in student writing. By emphasizing what instructors really want, both high school and college writing instructors can make writing assignments more equitable and begin to defend against their own social-class biases in the classroom. ^","Clinical / Case Study|Survey|Experimental|Philosophical / Theoretical| ~check","",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,1,1,1,0,3,"Education, Language and Literature|Education, Teacher Training|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Implicit response|Values|Writing|Social class|Response|Reflection|Literacy narratives","Adviser","Joanna Wolfe",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The first is that because there has been no historical collection or archival work, and subsequent analysis, of the research on class in composition, there has been little opportunity to reflect critically on the ways class has been defined, understood, and theorized in composition. Instead of working from past theorizations in order to develop new and more complex notions of class, writers have produced a series of seemingly new claims about the directions composition should explore in relation to class in writing courses. The second problem I see in the scholarship on class has been in the production of simplistic and narrow working-class pedagogies and, consequently, romantic representations of the working class. Writings about working-class academics, working-class students, and working-class literature have dominated the discussion of class in composition and have stilted complex theorizations of class and writing. ^ This attention to working-class pedagogies, though, suggests a significant strategy for an analysis of class in composition: to draw out the ways conceptions of working class have led to particular writing pedagogies. Instead of defining and articulating a theory of class, researchers have instead linked class to language, identity, and culture and devised pedagogies that have focused on these aspects of writing. I use language, identity, and culture, then, to form the structure of this dissertation. In citing the disproportionate scholarship on class compared to other political issues, like race, gender, and sexuality, writers have linked class with processes of language, identity, and culture_Êîthat is, by using the methodologies in work done, for example, on race or gender in composition as models, writers have focused on the social processes of language, identity, and culture. So writers have argued that class, like race or gender, is an issue of identity or culture and, as such, should be an important site of research. This dissertation identifies and analyzes representations of working class as a discourse, as identity, and as culture, then applies this analysis to a reading of the pedagogy of a basic writing course at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ^","Meta-Analysis / Discipliniography|Philosophical / Theoretical|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Historical / Archival","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Discourses|Working class|Pedagogies|Composition","Adviser","Alice Gillam",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Habermasean public sphere theory most often invoked in composition studies' discussion of public writing is appropriately complemented by these discursive understandings of publicness that help us address questions of individual rhetorical agency. The value of discourse-based investigations into public spheres_Êîincluding the classroom public_Êîis that this knowledge ""can be used to <italic> pursue a better</italic> public"" (Stob 27), characterized by access, active participation, and reciprocity with the discourses of other publics. ^ I integrate a range of theories including public sphere theory, post-process theory, and Bakhtinian dialogics to build this discursive understanding of the classroom as public.

Selfe, 1999, 2004; Wysocki, 2004; Sirc, 2002; Gee, 2003), not everyone views technology as a positive influence on writing instruction and production in this country. One particular genre under fire is social networking sites used by tech-savvy teens and others to post images, information, and diary-like blog entries. Latest estimates put the leading social networking site, MySpace, at 110 million active users with one in four Americans reported to have a MySpace profile (Owyang, 2008). The site is the fifth most visited site on the Web (Alexa, 2008) with millions logging on each day. It may, therefore, be negligent of those in composition studies to ignore a technological pastime taken up by so many of our students and based almost solely on users' composing practices involving both text and images. Although many have dismissed MySpace postings as nothing more than a teenage fad, the new medium's emphasis on multimodality, community building, and identity construction suggest this rhetorical practice is worth studying as one of the most prominent new media texts being utilized by young people. ^ This pilot study focuses on a sampling of profiles (the material ""text"" for MySpace) composed by females age 16-18 to interrogate the intersection of technology, gender performativity, and identity construction in this cyberspace. This pilot study is useful in classifying MySpace as the latest new media text being appropriated by women to build and expand their own notions of gender, specifically femininity, and also explores feminist research methodologies necessary for exploring such new media settings. Guided by the work of feminist researchers (Hill Collins, 2000; Naples, 2003; Sandoval, 2000) this study pays particular attention to an often marginalized group _Ê_ teenage females _Ê_ and the MySpace mode of communication that is so often marginalized within the academy. ^ Utilizing textual analysis, narrative, and some quantitative measures, the study considers rhetorical choices involving text, image, and design as well as ways such new media texts are influential in community building and performing modern feminine adolescence. With an emphasis on MySpace as a remediated new media text (Bolter & Grusin, 2000), this work explores the ways use of multiple media change both message and author (Manovich, 2001; Kress, 2003) and traces out this literacy practice as the latest used by women in constructing their on- and offline identities. A historical account of women's use of new media texts in recent centuries traces the lineage of women's appropriation of existing texts in the form of commonplace books, scrapbooks, autograph albums, note passing, and online texts. This study then utilizes a methodology steeped in both feminist and techno-feminist approaches with emphasis on textual analysis of a sample of 25 profiles interconnected by two primary profile creators. Relying on four guiding research questions, this work focuses mainly on the role MySpace plays in the performance of both womanhood and teenhood as well as ways utilizing the variety of media embedded within the MySpace application may shape users as rhetors and tech users as well as part of a larger community. The findings of this pilot study allow a better understanding of how teens are defining themselves and performing femininity within the MySpace community and may offer insight into future research and critical approaches to this and similar online communities and literacy practices. ^","Ethnographic ~check|Discourse or Text Analysis|Historical / Archival","",0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,0,3,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Mass Communications","New media|Literacy practice|MySpace|Girls|Gender|Identity construction","Adviser","Kristine L.

Two first-year writing classes taught in a computer laboratory by the same instructor participated in the study; one class used Chat and the other used the Discussion Board for invention prior to drafting the essays. I analyzed the online transcripts, student rough drafts, and the teacher and student interview data to describe the effects of both synchronous and asynchronous platforms as collaborative invention strategies on academic writing. Throughout the investigation, two research questions were addressed: (RQ #1) How effective is each type of online invention in generating ideas for writing academic essays? and (RQ #2) What attitudes/perceptions do the teacher and students have toward the collaborative online invention process? The descriptive findings generally indicate that the transfer of invention ideas and language patterns from both online forums to the essays (RQ #1) is directly supported by the teacher and student interview patterns (RQ #2). Significant data patterns reveal the following effects of Chat and Discussion Board invention forums on student drafts: both show _Ê_successful_Êù transfer of ideas in terms of essay topic, purpose, and thesis statement; _Ê_average_Êù transfer of main ideas and supporting details; and _Ê_minimal_Êù transfer of source ideas. However, the transfer of counterargument ideas from each forum differs: the use of Chat indicates _Ê_null_Êù transfer of ideas while _Ê_very minimal_Êù transfer is attributed to the use of the Discussion Board. Interview data patterns reveal agreement between the teacher and students as regards the capacity of each online forum to promote collaboration and knowledge construction. However, to support the contrasting transfer rates of counterargument ideas from Chat and Discussion Board forums, participants similarly expressed that meaningful and reflective interactions in Chat seem deficient due to its fluid and immediate setting as opposed to the capacity of the Discussion Board to sustain focused interactions and critical reflection.

How can literacy studies and rhetorical theory add to an understanding of feminist activism in historical, contemporary, and pedagogical contexts? How is the concept of subaltern counterpublics useful for considering the rhetorical space of feminist communities and the literacy sponsored within those spaces? How does the activist work of feminist communities sponsor communal literacy, a form of literacy rooted in practices of sharing?^ To answer these questions, I examine historical and contemporary Nebraska women's experiences with identity negotiation, literacy practices, and activism in three sites: (1) the Nebraska woman's suffrage movement; (2) Voices of Hope, an advocacy agency for survivors of sexual assault and/or domestic violence; and (3) a college course on feminist activism with a service learning component. Studying these sites through the lens of literacy studies and feminist rhetorical theory, I trace common threads of women's experiences claiming feminist and activist identities. Drawing on archival research, ethnographic observation, interviews, personal experiences, and analysis of newsletters, agency documents, and student writing, I offer a rich portrait of the challenges women activists face, the identity negotiation they undertake to engage in activism, and the ways that attention to literacy practices offers a critical lens for understanding women's civic participation in a democratic society.^ Pulling from the work of theorists in feminist rhetoric (Hollis, Johnson, Kates, Ritchie and Ronald) and identity theory (Alcoff, Butler, Goncalves, and Fraser), combined with scholarship in literacy studies on community literacy and literacy as social practice (Barton and Hamilton, Brandt, Cushman, and Grabill), I argue that the efficacy of women's activism is sponsored by emotional literacy which shapes individual identities prior to or as part of the forming of a collective community, and that emotional literacy continues to sponsor their activist endeavors. Integrating theories of literacy as a social practice with relational theories of literacy, I propose a theory of communal literacy: community-based literacy practices rooted in interpersonal connections, cross-cultural engagement, and practices of sharing that benefit a larger cause.^","Historical / Archival|Ethnographic|Rhetorical Analysis|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check","",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Activism|Feminism|Identity|Emotional literacy","Adviser","Amy M.

The writing evaluated was produced by students enrolled in inquiry-based college general chemistry laboratory classes which used the Science Writing Heuristic (SWH) approach. Fourteen freshman students participated in the first year of the study, Year I (fall 2003) and nineteen freshman students participated in the second year of the study, Year II (fall 2006). A framework using two different types of scoring was devised to evaluate the arguments. The first matrix scored each argument component separately and allocated a Total Argument score while the second matrix evaluated the arguments holistically. Three hundred and sixty-eight samples from thirty-three students were evaluated. Results indicate that students were able to use the SWH framework to produce reasonably good quality arguments which were generated from and embedded in a scientific inquiry. Despite fluctuations, argument scores tended to improve over the course of the semester. The argument scores were higher for Year I student who had the original SWH template than for Year II students who had two additional sections on the original SWH template. In some laboratory investigations, students obtained a higher average Holistic Argument score than an average Total Argument score. The evidence and the claims-evidence relationship components were identified as the most important predictors of the argument scores. Both Year I and Year II student argument scores were significantly correlated with the grade for the general chemistry laboratory course. The findings of this study suggest that science teachers should help students understand the importance of generating strong evidence to support a claim in order to produce a high quality of argument which emerged from scientific inquiry. ^","Discourse or Text Analysis ~check|Critical / Hermeneutical|Experimental","",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Sciences","Written argument|Science Writing Heuristic|Freshman|Chemistry laboratory","Advisers","Brian Hand; Robert E.

Whereas the European version of the jeremiad generally was intended to invoke social change as a secular virtue, the New England version melded spiritual and secular virtues together. It was not simply a matter of civic duty to create a new society, but a deeply spiritual one as well. According to literary scholar Sacvon Bercovitch, this particularly American jeremiad served as a basis for much of the national rhetoric that followed. ^ Focusing on two 20<super>th</super> century iconic _Ê_prophets_Êù of social change, Dorothy Day and Martin Luther King, Jr., and two individuals who continue to create new jeremiads, preacher and social activist Jim Wallis, and popular rock icon/activist Bono, this dissertation considers how the American jeremiad has been reshaped, re-imagined, and received during the last eighty years. It investigates if our culture still responds to prophetic rhetoric_Êîthat which provides a spiritual basis for secular change? ^ Using a model of the prophetic orator developed by theologian Walter Brueggemann, which theorizes the complex relationship between speaker, community, and vision in social justice rhetoric, I analyze the rhetorical features of these exemplars' speech and writing that promote vision and prompt action. Additionally, applying sociocultural linguistic theory, which considers all aspects of communication_Êîvisual and behavioral cues as well as spoken or written language_Êîto be forms of literacy, I examine the development of their rhetorical strategies. Each is a product of the literacy of their home community/culture. Each acquired a literacy of Christian belief. Each was/is able to use those literacies to break beyond the obstacles to cross-community dialogue in order to positively influence our culture. By focusing on the connective features of their Christian literacy and practice, this project demonstrates that discourse based on belief, so often cast as a divisive force in contemporary society, can be a catalyst for unification across community and energizes rhetorics of social justice. ^","Historical / Archival ~biographical|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Rhetorical Analysis","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Religion, General|Speech Communication|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Wallis, Jim|Social justice|Cultural literacy|King, Martin Luther, Jr.|American rhetoric|Literacy|Christian|Day, Dorothy","Adviser","Vincent G.

Qualitative data were gathered from 12 interviews of directors and ultrasound personnel from 7 states as well as from television advertisements and printed material. Eighteen research questions investigating the rhetorical transactions between centers and clients were answered. Rhetorical analyses were performed on the verbal and visual messages used in client interactions. ^ The grounded theory approach of inquiry resulted in the discovery of 10 major themes. First, centers offer holistic Christian ministry to clients. Second, centers provide professional health services. Third, a quest for uncertainty reduction and information brings clients to the centers. Fourth, centers maintain safe supportive environments. Fifth, personnel are trained to demonstrate sensitivity in sharing information. Sixth, staff exercise care in their deliberate choice of terms. Seventh, members recognize the importance of interpersonal communication in building relationships with and mentoring clients. Eighth, centers use persuasive arguments and artifacts. Ninth, ultrasound serves to reify the pregnancy for clients. Tenth, empowering clients to make their own decisions is a center goal. ^ A rhetorical critique was performed using three approaches. First, the rhetorical functions communicated by the visual artifacts were explored. Second, the individual elements of the visuals were examined for persuasive potential. Third, the possibility that the visual of the ultrasound image fills the eye of the beholder with a single dominant meaning was considered. The conclusion is that the apparent persuasive success of the ultrasound can be partially explained by the client's recognition of baby schema characteristics present in the fetus, recognition of the fetal heartbeat, and recognition of the beating heart as a symbol of life. The persuasive potential of the fetal position and fetal movement were also discussed. The role of storytelling was examined.

Writing teachers can better understand how and why college writers resist the composition classroom by analyzing extracurricular forums in which they produce a public discourse about their educational experience. Drawing on cultural studies, public sphere theory, Bakhtinian formalism, and critical gender and race studies, this dissertation advances the scholarship of resistance in composition studies beyond its usual focus on classroom politics. In an initial textual analysis of resistance in critical pedagogy and curricular theory, this work shows how the pedagogical framing of most discussions about resistance in composition has limited our collective understanding of the term. Moving on to a rhetorical analysis of Dartmouth College's student newspaper in the early 1970s, I use the specifics of this case study to argue that the ""student public"" has the potential to become a repository for socially conservative, resistant strategies that take shape at the fault line between the University and the culture at large. Advancing this argument about the student public into the digital age, I use discourse analysis and literacy theory to argue that college rating sites have become a ""wild public sphere,"" in which students critique and resist their college experience. Finally, in a return to the classroom, I use a combination of case study analysis and cultural theory to argue that plagiarism is a type of student resistance that typifies the importantly public dimensions of the term.

When the efforts of these travel writers are taken to be rhetorical, critics position themselves to identify how ethics, politics, and aesthetics of narration and self-representation create the tropes that fix other people in ideological space. This analysis examines the production of difference in selected travel narratives set in Cyprus in the later modern era, which coincides with the rise of anti-colonial politics, nationalism, and globalization (1955-2005). To further focus the analysis, I attend mostly to the representation of _Ê_the Turk_Êù in this textual genre. An introductory chapter examines the rhetorical situation of the travel text of Cyprus, exploring rhetorical and critical concepts such as ethos, rhetoric as popular culture, and tropology; it also surveys the landscape of Cyprus as a destination of travel and introduces some of the major texts to be considered. Subsequent chapters explore the rhetoric of narrated travel writing set in Cyprus according to its variations in style and historical epoch. The critique examines the ethics of narration and representation in memoirs, travelogues, political journalism, guide books, and ethnographies by a diverse range of writers including Lawrence Durrell, Colin Thubron, and Christopher Hitchens. A concluding chapter considers alternative, rhetorically self-conscious forms of travel and writing that suggest different possibilities for an ethical future of travel, travel narration, and cultural encounters. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Rhetorical Analysis ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Literature, Slavic and East European|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Travel|Turk|Travel writing|Cyprus|Ethos|Tropes|Rhetoric","Adviser","Ken S.

As a result, recent calls have been made for qualitative research that takes into consideration not only student reaction to feedback, but also the student's and instructor's prior experiences with writing, written feedback or other variables surrounding the classroom context (Ferris, 1995; 2003; Straub, 1999). ^ This study used a qualitative approach to examine two native speaking (L1) and two English Language Learner (L2) community college students' attitudes, expectations, and interpretations of the instructor's intended and deciphered expressive intonation in and use of written feedback on essays. Secondly, because two different populations of students were included (L1 and L2), this study also attempted to discern if there were a difference in how these two groups interpreted and utilized feedback. ^ The current study used several qualitative data collection instruments: informal participant screening instrument, classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, instructor think-aloud protocols, and stimulated elicitation interviews in tandem to collect some of the contextual data that had been lacking from the literature. ^ Michael Bakhtin's theory of the speech genre was used to discuss some of the neglected contextual elements surrounding written response. The findings were analyzed using Bakhtin's four elements of the speech genre: change of speakers, finalizability, expressive intonation, and addressivity. As examined through the lens of Bakhtinian theory, the students and the instructor were communicating in a speech genre. The distinction of being either L1 or L2 was not a significant factor in the findings. However, The teacher/student relationship established with three of the four students in a one-on-one conference became the key factor in the students' interpretation of the instructor's expressive intonation.

SSCM, a documentation methodology that is revolutionizing the practice of TC, requires technical communicators to adopt new technologies and to reconceptualize the business, communication, and information-development processes on which they have long relied. ^ To better understand why so many TC work groups struggle to achieve their goals for SSCM transition projects, I conducted as part of my dissertation project an eight-month qualitative study of a TC work group at a Fortune 100 manufacturing company. At the time of my study, the work group was in the process of transitioning from a traditional information-development environment that relied on desktop-publishing tools to one that relied on SSCM technologies. My dissertation draws on adoption and diffusion theory (ADT), cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), and the theory of the social construction of technology (SCOT) to examine the technology transfer process_Êîthe process by which the work group attempted to integrate a SSCM system into its work context and the process by which the system developer attempted to diffuse the SSCM system into the work group. ^ Extensive data analysis revealed that the technology transfer process was characterized by the work group not being able to evaluate the SSCM system apart from the activity system in which they were active participants, to the system developer's information transfer model of technology diffusion, and to the absence of a plan to guide the group's weekly transfer project activities. Rhetorical and sociotechnical factors shaped the technology transfer process at every stage, with the lack of appropriate regulative practices (mediating artifacts) having the most impact. ^ An increased understanding of how TC work groups attempt to integrate SSCM methodologies and tools into their activity systems helps TC scholars identify new opportunities for rhetorical action in SSCM environments and new knowledge and skill sets that TC practitioners need to ensure that people, not technology, are the end of TC work. I offer ""reciprocity"" as one way for TC scholars to identify such opportunities and to effect change through research. ^","Ethnographic|Model-Building ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Information Science","Content management|Communication|Information development|Technology transfer|Technology diffusion|Single sourcing|Technical communication","Adviser","Dave Clark",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study also explores the concepts of professionalism and ethics as they relate to freelance technical writers. Data tools include email surveys, email interviews, and phone interviews. Respondents were categorized into two groups, according to their access to their clients' corporate culture information: the High Corporate Culture group and the Low Corporate Culture group. Although both groups are successful and do not believe they work from a disadvantage as they freelance, they work very differently. High Corporate Culture group members largely have previous in-house experience as full-time writers for at least one of their clients, and perhaps as a result, structure their freelance work very similarly to how they worked when employed as full-time permanent employees. Few Low Corporate Culture group members have worked in-house for their clients and prefer to do most, if not all, of their work via remote. Low Corporate Culture respondents rely on patterns to acquire information regarding new clients. They seek patterns based on clients they have already worked with.

The specific example utilized is the adaptation of domestic visual craft into sociopolitical rhetorics by women in the United States. Situated predominantly in domestic textile production and growing from the purely American tradition of patchwork quilting, this dissertation builds from quilt making to investigate selected historically-rooted locations of alternate rhetorics. Subsequent chapters include analyses of <underline> The Dinner Party</underline> by Judy Chicago as Second Wave feminist personal and community narrative, Third Wave feminism and craftivism, and cancer journals as visual autobiography. ^ This project also introduces the term Philomela Syndrome signifying those peoples who have been physically or metaphorically silenced by a dominant group in society, utilizing the terms feminized and masculinized to denote disempowered and empowered groups. Further, this text establishes Reclamation Theory as the process by which a marginalized group discards an outward demarcation of difference to promote equality and later may reclaim it when a modicum of equality is established so as to celebrate diversity. ^ Ultimately, these considerations of alternate discourses lead to a discussion of visual pedagogies designed for undergraduates enrolled in general education English Studies courses. These alternate pedagogies are intended to undermine a real or perceived sense of silencing that non-English majors experience in required composition and literature classes by recognizing their diverse knowledges as participants in a visual media society and attempt to provided concrete explanations and examples for the ambiguous nature of writing and literary instruction. These visual pedagogies can lead to a greater level of student comprehension and retention, as well as eradicating some of the feelings of frustration that students may have with these courses while promoting a deeper stage of critical thinking and analysis. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Education, Language and Literature|Literature, General|Women's Studies|Literature, American|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Women's literature|Autobiography|Pedagogy|Women's studies|Visual pedagogies|Women writers|Visual studies|Alternate discourses","Adviser","Cynthia Huff",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the purpose of this study, the researcher focused on data collection through interviews wherein the senior volunteers told their story or stories to the researcher as well as through written backgrounds. The study focused on 11 senior citizens who volunteered at a hospital in San Francisco.

In addition, eight types of oral tradition were present in the narratives alongside oral history. ^ Given that many of the stories told were oral history and revolved around personal experiences through historical atrocities, it was apparent that these seniors felt the need to share what they had experienced. Thus, oral history was a major component in all of the narratives. The researcher concluded that this inclusion of oral history highlighted the need for the storyteller to inject themselves and their relationship to the story into the telling.

While scholars of rhetoric have addressed these topics discretely, most have neglected their conceptual intersection, or, at least, they have passed through it rather quickly. This dissertation accepts the crossing as an opportunity for pause_Êîa juncture that, in and of itself, calls for examination. I argue that by drawing from the literature on both kairos and, to a lesser extent, revelatory discourse, we can better understand the way revelation works rhetorically in a political world. Kairos is often translated as _Ê_right timing and due measure,_Êù a broad definition that allows the concept to transcend disciplinary boundaries. But one adverse consequence of this broad interpretation is that kairos has become indistinctive. It seems to be almost synonymous with a wide variety of other terms in rhetorical theory. ^ I adopt and develop a lesser known definition of kairos as _Ê_God's time._Êù By applying this definition to religious rhetorical artifacts, I argue that we can come to a fuller understanding of the way religious rhetoric influences its audiences and frames the political world in terms of divine imperatives. I look at three texts: The National Cathedral in Washington D.C.; Martin Luther King Jr.'s last Sunday sermon, which was delivered from the pulpit of the National Cathedral; and George W. Bush's address to the nation on the September 14, 2001, which was also delivered from the cathedral pulpit. I situate my analysis within the cathedral, because it is uniquely well designed to illustrate the way religion appropriates political culture and history.

The dissertation begins by outlining the project's research questions, categories for analysis, sources from which Katrina survivors' writing are chosen to be analyzed, and my proposed theory of relocation. My work relies on concepts associated with New Literacy Studies (NLS), including social theories of literacy which support my contentions that literacy practices are contextualized, and that displaced Katrina survivors who write about home use the page as a new location from which to explore place. I also consult writing by Katrina survivors to tease apart the multiple approaches that Katrina survivors take to writing about home, ergo the kinds of homes created in writing. Further, I maintain that active, prolific communities exist as a result of online Katrina writing. Survey and interview responses drawn from in the latter part of the dissertation affirm, complicate, or contradict earlier analysis and conclusions.^ This dissertation is divided into five chapters. The first chapter, alluded to above, introduces the project, its significance within composition studies, and clarifies the project's definitions of literacy, place, and displacement. Chapter Two reviews NLS, ethnographic literacy studies and social theories of literacy as well as composition scholarship and narratives that are foundational to my work. Other writings that offer varying perspectives of literacy, place, identity, and displacement are reviewed in this chapter.^ Chapter Three discusses the project's participants, methodological foundations, including approaches from which surveys and interviews were created and implemented. This chapter also summarizes the sources I drew Katrina writing from, and finally acknowledges the complicated nature of ethnographic methods, including my position as researcher and participants as collaborators.^ Chapter Four analyzes Katrina writing, categorizing and highlighting key treatments of home, as well as passages about identity and displacement. Chapter Five concludes the dissertation, sharing survey and interview responses from participants that support my maintenance that writing creates a textual home, and that Katrina survivors benefit from writing about home, especially for its ability to create easily accessible communities.^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Survey|Interview / Focus Group ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Displacement|Hurricane Katrina|Place|Identity|Writing|Literacy|Rhetoric|Composition","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ueland's book, <italic> If You Want to Write</italic> (1938) is used as an organizing device for examining life experiences in relation to writing, and writing experiences in relation to living. ^ This investigation, situated in the field of composition and rhetoric, aligns with a human science approach, as described by Max Van Manen and demonstrated in the work of Sondra Perl (see, especially, <italic>On Austrian Soil</italic>). Such an approach includes consideration of the researcher's own experience in developing understandings through writing and reflection. This investigation into Brenda Ueland's life and writing also calls on methods related to feminist biography, ethnographic life history, and the researcher's experience in journalism, women's history, and creative writing. Its goal is to provide a view of writing _Ê_in the midst of life and over the course of a lifetime_Êù that encourages researchers, teachers, and writers themselves to take into account the relationships between and among people who write, personal and public reasons for writing, the material and cultural circumstances that surround acts of writing, and the experience of writing at any particular moment, especially as it accumulates over a lifetime. ^ This dissertation aims to encourage writers, scholars, and students to think differently_Êîand with more acceptance_Êîabout writing and what we are involved in when we sit down at a keyboard or pick up a pen.

However, their disciplinary investment continues to be exclusively focused on western and Judeo-Christian conciliation traditions. This narrow focus mandates research on rhetorical dimensions of indigenous peacemaking practices in other cultural traditions. This dissertation directs attention to an enduring, fourteen-centuries-old, Arab-Islamic conciliation practice called sulh, and contends that conciliation participants are rhetorical agents <italic>par excellence</italic>, who rhetorically negotiate (divergent) conciliatory exigences and goals as well as deliberate peacemaking measures. To this end, I explicate how conciliators optimize rhetorical stances and moves to listen to subjects' grievances; balance incompatible restorative needs and interpellate peace pursuers who move forward to peacebuilding. ^ Drawing on ethnographic research, treatises and historical accounts of sulh, this study expounds symbolic and procedural sulh as two interdependent and rhetorically negotiated dimensions. Moreover, it explicates how sulh transcends a simple apology-forgiveness dynamic. Rather, sulh optimizes the power of promise and acknowledgment to initiate a peacemaking practice that problem-solves, transforms and constitutes. My rhetorical analysis of sulh leads to a culturally-situated study of former President Al-Sadat's 1977 peace initiative, demonstrating how his discourse, especially his Knesset Address, is an exemplary peacemaking rhetorical intervention. What's unique is that sulh was an effective, cultural resource whose expressive, functional and constitutive forces were enlisted to initiate peace deliberation and constitute peace pursuers, who would value peaceful Egyptian-Israeli relations. ^ To generate an eclectic, data-driven, analytical framework that captures the intricacies of peacemaking, this dissertation synthesizes critical rhetoric and critical discourse analysis (CR and CDA, respectively). Both perspectives are attentive to status quo (trans)formation and how discourses interpellate/constrain subjects. Because CR and CDA draw on different disciplines, my analysis makes use of analytical categories from linguistics, discourse analysis and rhetoric, including deliberative, epideictic and constitutive rhetoric; rhetorical listening; stock topics; speech and thought representation and clause relations. Synthesizing CR and CDA resulted in a nuanced, multidimensional study of a culturally-inflected peacemaking rhetoric. As such, this dissertation extends peace and composition and rhetoric studies, explicating how rhetoric is decisive in changing the dialectics of conflict and conflict-resolution on individual, communal and international levels. ^","Historical / Archival|Rhetorical Analysis|Discourse or Text Analysis ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Peace Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Sulh|Reconciliation|Peacemaking|Arab Islamic|Conciliation discourse|Egypt-Israel|Rhetoric|Sadat, Anwar","Adviser","Deborah Brandt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, critical investigations into the nature and limits of participation so far have remained on the fringes of new media scholarship.

Building on Mikhail Bakhtin_Ê_s concepts of utterance, monologue and dialogue, this dissertation offers an interpretive approach that places a speaker/writer_Ê_s unique utterance within a context characterized by preexisting discursive and non-discursive contents both on the level of the website and on the level of cultural narratives, images, assumptions and beliefs. More precisely, the approach shows how a speaker/writer_Ê_s utterance is determined by two spheres of meaning. On the one hand, the utterance attains meaning through its relationship to the hosting website_Ê_s visual/textual bias (imagetext). On the other hand, an utterance is determined by the speaker_Ê_s unique locatedness in heteroglossia, that is, the culturally and socially circulating languages and images which surround her, in which she partakes and which characterize her as a speaker belonging to a certain cultural context. By describing participants_Ê_ communicative activities as dynamically situated between monologic (exclusive, unifying) and dialogic (inclusive, spontaneous) tendencies, the dialogic approach developed in this dissertation goes beyond the scope of traditional approaches to rhetorical analysis, which commonly focus on strategies of persuasion in mostly unidirectional communication situations. ^","Ethnographic ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Monologue|German-American|Intercultural|German-American immigration|Bakhtin, Mikhail|Online board|Online forum|Dialogue","Adviser","Ekaterina V.

I explore the transnational implications of the written products of this international organization, and examine the ways that it writes and has written international borders and transnational migrants. I argue that the treaties protecting the mobile body articulate three ""periods"" during which the figuration of the mobile body is distinct: the first group emerges amidst the anti-vice rhetoric of the first part of the twentieth century; the second is marked by the production of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948; and the third is signaled by the 2000 International Treaty on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. I draw on critical rhetoric, transnational feminism, political philosophy, feminist geography and the stories told by transnational migrant writers in order to interrogate, historicize, and demystify this collection of texts. My dissertation recognizes that current international discourses project a rhetoric of crisis which circulates among discussions of sovereignty, human rights, and transnational migration. I establish that the Conventions occupy a paradoxical space in that they are embedded in and indebted to the very same discourses of globalization and the nation-state that they work rhetorically to mitigate. ^ In sum, I argue in this dissertation that treaty writing in the UN Assembly increasingly resists the hysterics of crisis with a precision that seeks to identify and (re)cover any body left unprotected by national law; however, as written products, the conventions also reify national borders and reduce the migrant body to an 'object of study,' an abject form in need of protection. I submit that little work in Rhetorical Studies has focused on the United Nations, even though the UN is the only institution in existence that claims to represent, literally, ""everyone,"" and, if for that reason only, it demands further study. With the UN Conventions as a starting point, this dissertation engages and extends ideas with which Rhetorical Studies might intervene and participate in more transnational conversations. ^","Rhetorical Analysis|Critical / Hermeneutical|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Geography|Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Borders|Transnational feminism|United Nations|Rhetoric|Migration|Multilateral treaties|Mobile body","Adviser","Margaret Himley",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a series of semi-structured research sessions_Êînine individual interviews and six focus group conversations_Êîthe researcher met with 31 college students to ask questions and prompt discussion about plagiarism.^ Plagiarism has been of broad interest to the academy, and scholars from Composition Studies and other disciplines have examined it through theoretical and empirical lenses. Their research has revealed substantial disagreements in the ways that plagiarism has been constructed and represented within the academy. Some studies have explored how college students understand and negotiate the academic construction of plagiarism; few studies, however, have asked what college students see when they consider the topic.^ This dissertation employs a phenomenological research approach; it seeks to understand plagiarism as it is understood and experienced by college students themselves. The study addresses plagiarism both as a concept and as an act with significant ideological, ethical, institutional, and pragmatic aspects. In doing so, it considers some of the social, ethical, and textual implications of contemporary Western conventions and expectations regarding source use and citation, and it addresses the nature and function of source-based writing in college.^ Based on an analysis of the conversation from the study's interview and focus group sessions, the dissertation presents, describes, and analyzes the research participants' construction and representation of plagiarism. The students' voices, stories, and experiences reveal a series of alignments with and disconnections from many of the primary beliefs and assumptions we hold about plagiarism, authorship, and student writers. The teaching and policy implications of these alignments and disconnections are at times confirmatory, at times unsettling.

In doing so, the voice is heard not on the side of a speaking subject but on the side of an object that either guarantees or disrupts persuasion.^ Through a study of this oscillation, there emerges the voice's paradoxical aspect as a concept that speaks through the history of composition and rhetoric as an excluded real that is either a threat that disrupts the possibility of reasonable persuasion or as an origin we have lost sight of and need to return to. In both cases, voice is an <italic>affective</italic> object that either guarantees or disrupts persuasion. The voice, as an element that is at once included in and excluded from rhetoric, is not an accident of the way that persuasion is understood but acts as a constitutive force of its definition. This conceptualization of the included/excluded nature of the voice has a number of consequences for theories of identity, invention, writing, bodies, and beliefs.

Posing questions such as ""What is rhet-comp?"" or ""What is English?"" or even ""What is writing?"" has become more than just a routine way of self-reflexively engaging the discipline. For some critics, it suggests that we are in a perpetual state of disciplinary crisis. Not content to read these phenomena as either expressions of professional anxiety or as unproductive, limiting conflicts, <italic> The Composition of Crisis</italic> diagnoses the complex of conditions that constitute crisis as central to not only rhetoric and composition studies, but also English, the humanities, and indeed the university itself, as it exists both as an idea and as a modern social institution.^ Taking seriously (and working within) rhet-comp's long commitment to doing work that is socially conscious, institutionally aware, and culturally expansive, this project historicizes the <italic>idea</italic> of crisis as a constructed, transient symptom of disciplinary demarcation and boundary-setting. Through an extended engagement with these practices of identity-formation, crisis emerges in this project as a key diagnostic framework through which to examine the ways in which academic disciplines, fields, and even individuals make sense of their ever-contingent identities and their embeddedness within increasingly market-driven institutions of higher learning. It is against this backdrop of the contemporary university that I explore the rise of a politico-economic rationality most often referred to as neoliberalism, and my analyses in these areas further contribute to our understanding of the status of the university vis-a-vis advanced capital and its complex relations with the state. Returning to more discipline-specific sites in Chapters 2 through 5, my dissertation traces the circulation of crisis through such familiar haunts as the Dartmouth Seminar and the space of ""the classroom"" (Chapter 3); the theory/practice ""split"" and the discourse on TA training (Chapter 4); and the crisis in academic labor (Chapter 5). I ultimately argue that not only is crisis a productive force, but that it is also a necessary one, because crisis is immanent to the dynamics of identity. Hence, any attempt to ""do away with crisis"" (a popular refrain in both rhet-comp and English studies), would be tantamount to saying that we should jettison (disciplinary) identity.^ Engaging head-on the crisis in academic labor, this project concludes by attempting to shift the focus of the so-called ""pedagogical imperative"" in rhetoric and composition studies, suggesting that we become differently attuned to teaching and pedagogy, and, specifically, that the diverse array of challenges posed by the neoliberal university demand that we learn to understand and <italic>respond</italic> differently to the question of what it means to teach or to ""do"" writing pedagogy in the contemporary academy.

Research in composition studies, in addition, have emphasized that writing is a cognitive tool. Vygotsky (1978, 1986), whose theories provided the conceptual framework for this study, viewed writing as an important tool in developing higher order thinking skills. As a result, this qualitative study sought to discover whether teachers in Catholic secondary schools in a Northern California diocese used writing to help students think and learn. ^ The researcher interviewed eight teachers in the subject areas of English, history. mathematics. religion, and science. The three research questions driving the study focused on teachers' understanding of the term metacognition, teachers' use of writing to foster metacognitive skills, and the obstacles teachers faced when using writing to help students learn. Data were collected from participants' responses to an interview protocol. Responses were recorded digitally, transcribed, and then interpreted through a thematic analysis approach. Although two of the eight participants were unfamiliar with the term metacognition, all of the participants indicated that they had developed strategies for teaching subject-specific writing skills. In addition, they were sensitive to learning styles and aspired to foster their students' critical thinking skills. In fact, several of the participants taught their students metacognitive strategies. The types of writing the eight participants assigned were both expository and imaginative and ranged in frequency from once a week to once a year. Participants, though, faced four obstacles when using writing as a learning tool. These were teachers' clarity in articulating expectations and assessment criteria; the amount of time required to comment on and grade written assignments; students' lack of the critical thinking skills, and sometimes the basic skills, needed for academic writing; and students' resistance to challenging writing assignments and to those they considered irrelevant to the subject matter. In contrast to the Commission's 2003 report, this researcher found that her participants taught writing, valued it as a learning and thinking tool, and, to various degrees, used writing to foster students' metacognitive awareness. ^","Interview / Focus Group|Clinical / Case Study ~check","",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Education, Secondary|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Curriculum and Instruction","Catholic education|Secondary schools|Writing across the curriculum|Vygotsky, Lev|Metacognition","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I contend that the Red Letter Christians engage in biblical reading strategies that make them distinct from other politically liberal or progressive religious groups. The Red Letter Christians employ a moral frame based on their particular reading of the Bible. Embedded in the notion of ""conservative radicalism,"" such a moral frame asserts a dedication to timeless principles and truths authenticated by the gospel accounts of Jesus while it simultaneously upholds a passionate defense of social justice and the activist need to engage in political action in the present. Such a moral frame is biconceptual, expressing both conservative and progressive dimensions of moral social action. Due to the biconceptuality of the Red Letter Christian moral frame, Red Letter Christians often stress the importance of humility and non-partisan dialogue. Critics of the Red Letter Christians from both the political left and the right argue that such discourse is often incomprehensible and obfuscates the political positions the group defends in their rhetoric. I assert that in spite of their common reception as a religiously liberal group, the Red Letter Christians offer a model of discourse that at its best authenticates and otherwise justifies a model of post-partisan discourse that re-imagines religion's role in public political discourse. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Ethnographic ~check","",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Religion, General|Religion, Philosophy of|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Interpretive persuasion|Red Letter Christians|Religion|Hermeneutics|Democracy|Moral framing|Rhetoric","Adviser","Kirt H.

It presents the results of over two years of ethnographic observation and interviews with a multidisciplinary pain management organization. Additionally, it interrogates two broader cases of agency and regulation in pain science: (1) the debate over the nature of the sinus headache and (2) the debate surrounding the legitimacy of the chronic pain condition fibromyalgia. Following recent theoretical work in rhetorical studies, this dissertation argues that the rhetoric of pain science corroborates recent theoretical suggestions that the exercise of both agency and regulation is predicated on structures of authority. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that when clinicians seek change in medical science or healthcare regulation, they rely on authority provided to them by their disciplinary identity--an identity supported by the same structures they seek to change. Similarly, the exercise of regulation in the medical-industrial complex is often based on identical structures of authority. Finally, in exploring these issues, this dissertation also argues for more inquiry in the emerging subfield known as rhetoric of technoscience. The work of this dissertation demonstrates the methods and modes of inquiry for rhetoric of technoscience and reflects on how such modes of inquiry are different from rhetorics of science and technology, as traditionally conceived. Ultimately, this work argues for greater attention to issues of ontology and materiality as well as continued exploration into how those issues impact scientific and policy discourses. ^","Ethnographic|Rhetorical Analysis ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Speech Communication|Technical Communication|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Discourse in health and medicine|Technoscience|Rhetoric of medicine|Medicine|Pain|Regulation|Rhetoric|Agency","Adviser","Carl G.

Specifically, it examines how the rhetoric of fair play functions as a resource for both resistance and social control. The rhetoric of fair play refers to a set of debates and discussions over the structure and meaning of competitive sport. The project proposes three tensions within fair play rhetoric: Discipline or Freedom, Rules as Control or Transformation, and the Universal or Political Athlete. Drawing upon the theoretical resources of liberal, radical and materialist feminism, as well as the cultural theory of Michel Foucault and Raymond Williams, the project argues that values of fairness and meritocracy within sport function dialectically to both empower demands for social change and to extend preexisting hierarchies. A number of questions guided this project: What social norms are at stake during sport competitions? How does fair play rhetoric uphold or challenge these norms? On what basis does fair play rhetoric challenge status quo social conditions? On what basis does it uphold them? And finally, how do the assumptions behind various usages of fair play rhetoric enable and limit their effects on society? Three case studies demonstrate how consecutive women_Ê_s sport administrators at Texas used claims to fair play to negotiate the dialectic tension of transcendent claims to sport identity and particular attachments to gender within women_Ê_s involvement in sport. Rhetorical tactics shifted from an invocation of sport_Ê_s public welfare benefits to political activism on behalf of women_Ê_s right to compete at sport. The project sets these varied tactics of sport advocacy within broader contexts of first wave feminism, interwar period Progressivism, social transformations of World War II, Civil Rights activism, and second wave feminism of the 1970s, culminating in the passage of Title IX. The dissertation concludes that the rhetoric of fair play exists within sport, and beyond, as a powerful form of discourse that can be wielded for social control or challenge. What is considered _Ê_playing fair_Êù may change with time and perspective but the stakes remain high and thus merit scholarly attention. ^","Historical / Archival|Rhetorical Analysis ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Women's Studies|Education, History of|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Recreation","Liberalism|Fair play|Women athletes|University of Texas|Title IX|Texas|Sport|Rhetorical","Adviser","Dana L.

It examines the literature to understand how the alcohol of each culture (Wine, Mead or Ale) was handled. These two cultures were chosen because both exhibit a standard literary record as well as being relatively equivalent regarding technology and cultural influences in the centuries of study: roughly 800BC_Ê_200BC for the Greeks and 700AD_Ê_1300AD for the Germanics. ^ In order to contextually explore the literature this dissertation uses tools found in the field of Rhetoric. The specific tool used to explore alcohol in myth is the Rhetorical Situation, adjusted for the field of Mythological Studies. The Rhetorical Situation is used to study the interaction between the Audience, the Rhetor, and the Rhetoric. The interaction between the three highlights the choices made by each culture as they deal with the symbol and reality of alcohol. ^ In order to understand the Audience, Daniel Dubuiosson's idea of the Cosmographic Formation is adjusted. Rather than applying it to the entire culture, it focuses on the main elements which would affect alcohol usage: social structure, belief system, geography, technology, and economic system. These elements affected both the audience and the Rhetor, and would explain the choices made in the rhetoric.^ The Rhetoric _Ê_ the myths themselves _Ê_ is categorized with the Mythologic Schema. This schema categorizes a myth on a diagram representing three aspects of mythology: Supranormal, History and Ritual. By using the schema, the myths are compared as equally as possible between the cultures. This equality ensures that the conclusions reached through the study are contextually sound for each culture, and can be extrapolated to underline what is necessary to handle alcohol in myth and society.^ The context of each culture adjusted the choices made by the Rhetor, and affected the way that alcohol was portrayed in the myths. The results of this study showed that the power of alcohol was mitigated by the consequences suffered by the characters. Alcohol was controlled in both cultures by having a standard narrative which justified the cultural response to drinking. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Literature, Classical|Literature, Comparative|Folklore|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Alcohol rhetoric|Mead|Greek|Mythology|Germanic|Ale|Wine","Adviser","Evans Lansing-Smith",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The concept of evil has been employed in a way that marginalizes and villainizes individuals, groups, and even entire communities. Moreover, when they are deployed in a visual medium, the ideas and concepts conveyed are often not interrogated as closely as a written work would be. As a result, the guiding question of inquiry for this project is: <italic>How have western notions of good and evil been deployed and employed as a mechanism of hegemony and marginalization </italic>? In order to answer this question, this dissertation is primarily concerned with the visual depiction of morality. That is, it seeks to examine how good and evil are depicted images and how those depictions are ideologically-based. As a starting point, I examine textual representations of evil and posit _Ê_the text_Êù as a hegemonic and established object of study and the visual as often dismissed as non-academic, trivial, or frivolous. Consequently, I argue that images and visuals in popular culture represent an important tool for imparting ideology.^ This project represents a marrying of many rhetorical areas of inquiry by examining a core but accessible object of study. The perceived good/evil dichotomy is one that plays itself out in a variety of societal arenas. Particularly, graphic novels, whose adaptations form one of the more recent trends in popular film, provide fertile ground for the interrogation of societal values and mores. As such, pop culture artifacts represent an important area of study due to their ready acceptance by the public often without resistance or critical engagement.^","Cultural-Critical Studies|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Evil|Morality|Mapping|Rhetoric|Visual|Composition","Adviser","Carlos Salinas",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is a mixed methods, longitudinal, descriptive, writer-centered study. The research purpose was to explore strategic competence as a catalyst for professional proficiency in the scholarly (academic) writing of international Master of Laws (LL.M.) students who need to show analytical thinking and communicative precision in their research papers and law review articles. The theoretical framework views scholarly writing in a second language as developmental learning in two domains, language and law, and as socialized cultural practice.^ The study showed how scholarly legal writing was both a cognitive and a social-cultural process for participants (N=6) as they shifted from the writer-centered activity of drafting to the reader-centered activity of revising and constructing knowledge. A triangulated, multi-stage design was used to collect the quantitative and qualitative data at recursive stages of writing (that is, pre-writing, drafting, and revising). The instruments developed for collecting the data raised strategy awareness for participants in the study and can be used for teaching. The research contributes to our knowledge of scholarly writing in the professions, helps us understand challenges and strategies for L2 writers in graduate programs, provides a useful way to conduct a mixed-methods writing study, reveals the interface between L2 and L1 academic legal discourse, and offers tested tools for developing professional-level competence in academic writers.^ The study bridges the L1 research and L2 research literature by exploring how superior language learners used research-based strategies to build on their existing competences for professional-level research writing. This highly contextualized, learner-centered research contributes to several related fields by addressing L2 issues associated with plagiarism, the native-speaker standard, learner self-assessment and self-editing_Êîall of which are issues of cross-cultural literacy.

The research project demonstrated what the review of literature suggests: Humor is potentially a very effective way to build a comfortable and unrestrained relationship of mutual confidence between preachers and congregations. The effective use of sacred humor also enables preachers to build ethos with their congregations and move the congregations to deeper levels of affective learning. Although the perceived humor orientation of the preachers and relational solidarity between the preachers and the listeners were important, the perceived ethos of the preachers demonstrated to be the highest predictor of affective learning.

Contemporary France is an especially rich case for analysis because of the pervasive and lasting controversies over national identity that have occurred there in recent years.

Tracing various accounts of the concept across the history and theory of rhetoric, I show that concealment in rhetoric has been figured in at least two defining ways: the first more problematically as a form of purposeful dissembling or deception and the other more positively as a potentially useful tactic that speakers or writers may learn to employ in order to better persuade their audiences. While each of these accounts has been helpful at specific moments in rhetoric's history, I argue that both leave rhetoricians ill-equipped to address other ways concealment functions in communication. To reassess the problem of concealment in rhetoric and what it might mean to think concealment otherwise, I turn to two areas_Êîphenomenology and wireless computing_Êîwhere concealment has been figured differently than in the rhetorical tradition. In contrast to the largely ""instrumental"" conceptions of concealment scattered across the rhetorical tradition, researchers in phenomenology and wireless computing tend to conceive of concealment as a necessary and generative feature of human existence itself, one that shapes, in ways that cannot be directly known or controlled, how we eventually come to understand ourselves and communicate with others in the world. Through phenomenological examinations of handheld cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other digital devices embedded imperceptibly throughout the built environment, I propose in this project another, less instrumental or human-centric, way of understanding concealment that acknowledges its integral role in constituting the very possibilities of communication and, indeed, all lived experience. In so doing, I develop a more nuanced theoretical framework_Êîwhat I term a ""rhetorical phenomenology of human-technology relations""_Êî that enables rhetoricians to more productively address the various forms concealment takes in wireless computing culture and the bearing these forms have on how we learn to live and communicate with others today. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical ~flag|Model-Building|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check|Rhetorical Analysis","visual rhetorical analysis of objects",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,1,0,1,"Ethics|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Phenomenology|Rhetoric|Concealment|Ethics|Wireless|Technology","Adviser","Michael Bernard-Donals",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In other contexts, collaborative writing can more closely resemble the ""conventional ethos"" (Knobel and Lankshear, 2007) of more individualistic notions of authorship often tied to print. With writing projects such as WoWWiki, we can observe a dramatic shift in notions of textual ownership and production towards the communal and collaborative, and I suggest the patterns of collaboration found on WoWWki are evidence of a larger technocultural shift signaling new conditions for literacy. In the midst of this shift, the meaning of ""collaboration,"" ""authorship,"" and ""audience"" is redefined. ^ Following my introductory chapter, I use textual analysis of talk pages to examine the talk pages of several of WoWWiki featured articles for particular patterns of language use and identify what WoWWikians focus their attention on in the process of writing articles. I argue that collaboration on WoWWiki poses a challenge to models of face to face writing groups and offers unique patterns of collaboration. ^ I then contend that WoWWiki's writing practices are entering a society where the idea of the single author has been strong. Nevertheless, I find evidence of a shared model of text production and collaborative notion of authorship; further, collaboration is disrupted by those who hold author-centric perspectives. ^ Next, I argue that our previous models of audience and writing previously developed around print and, later, hypertext are inadequate because they cannot account for roles readers can take and how writers and readers interact on a wiki. With this new arrangement in collaborative writing evident on WoWWiki, I develop the hypersocial-interactive model of wiki-mediated writing. ^ I conclude by reviewing this dissertation's main arguments regarding wiki-mediated collaborative writing, after which I explore the implications of using wikis for writing instruction. Finally, I discuss the limitations of this study and consider directions for future research on voluntary collaborative wiki-mediated writing. ^","Discourse or Text Analysis|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,1,0,1,0,2,"Multimedia Communications|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","New media|Collaborative writing|Writing groups|Authorship|Audience|Wiki","Adviser","Deborah Brandt",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

(Powell, Villanueva, Williams, Lu, Royster, Anzaldua). As writers, we always take ourselves with us into our writing and teaching, but complication comes into play when we assume that we need to leave the personal behind. This assumption is prevalent when writing and working from within stereotypical, traditional, academic paradigms. If one is working from a stereotypical mainstream view, the use of the personal is often seen to get in the way of objective scholarship. I respond to Victor Villanueva_Ê_s call to include the personal as a necessary method of _Ê_critique, not only of the world around [us], but of [ours]selves and [our] predispositions_Êù by proposing a way of approaching scholarly work that I have termed <italic> being-in-relation-to.</italic> This concept flows from indigenous tradition(s) that assert everything is related and is of value.

The goal is to bring scholars to a recognition of the complexities, similarities, and differences among them with the intent of furthering understandings of each other.^ This dissertation is an introspective journey where I consider the dissonance between what I originally perceived as a chasm between personal beliefs, values, and worldviews and the professional world of academia. Through analysis of selected works of Victor Villanueva, Patricia Williams, and Min-Zhan Lu, I make the case that scholars from non-_Ê_mainstream_Êù backgrounds, who view the world through less individualistic and more communal lenses, can begin to reconcile their disparate worlds through the models that these scholars offer. These models embody the importance of witnessing from and being witness to the very complex perspectives they inhabit through locating themselves in their scholarly work, using parable, poetry, and parody, making connections between their psyches and our lived experiences and social perception, and offering implicit and/or explicit discussions of their challenges and struggles. Approaching scholarship and teaching through being-in-relation-to enables a gathering of multiple narratives, which facilitates productive exchanges across difference. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Critical / Hermeneutical|Poetic / Fictive ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,1,2,"Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Relationship|Personal writing|Productive dialogues|Being-in-relation-to|Nontraditional scholarship","Adviser","Marilyn M.

This dissertation focuses on several key episodes when rhetoric_Ê_s evaluative corporeal vocabulary becomes explicitly editorial, as demonstrated by representations of _Ê_corpus care._Êù In a bodily idiom, certain ancient writers purport to reveal the time and labor they have spent preparing a text for publication or to demean writers who do not bother with textual polish.

Drawing on education, English studies, globalization theory, applied linguistics, translation studies, multiculturalism, and second-language studies, this project engages in a study of multilingual students from writing courses at a Canadian university. The analysis focuses on the relationships between Canadian multilingualism and current U.S. scholarship surrounding English monolingualism in terms of eradicationism, language segregation, and language interaction. ^ The findings challenge previous research and popular opinion, as well as Canadian government policy, all of which tend to designate Canadian classrooms and society as definitively accepting of cultural and linguistic diversity. Instead, this project positions Canadian writing classrooms as aligned with eradicationist ideologies, which is a noteworthy contrast to growing calls by composition scholars for teaching translingual composition. The data collected situates Canadian students (like U.S. students) as extremely ethno-linguistically diverse; however, in Canada, this diversity continues to be confined to home communities. ^ This research offers a critical assessment of how U.S. and Canadian post-secondary institutions can employ multilingualism as a resource, suggesting ways in which linguistic diversity can position students to excel in cultural exchange and political dialogue. Through drawing upon the ways a selection of U.S. compositionists have been successful in their employment of student multilingualism as a pedagogical resource, this project responds to gaps in international multilingual scholarship and validates the introduction of multicultural-multilingual initiatives into Canadian writing classrooms. This work calls on composition researchers and instructors, particularly those in Canada, to redefine writing pedagogy and curricula in order to consider how institutions that boast high levels of cultural and linguistic diversity can proactively address and make use of multilingualism. ^","Survey ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Higher","Immigrants|Canada|Multilingual|Language choice|Allophone|Writing","","Bruce M.

A random sampling of Pollard's sermons from 1986 to 2001 were analyzed based on an analytical tool derived from Robinson's homiletical writings. The researcher then deduced pastoral and homiletical implications based upon the findings of the research. ^ This study revealed that Pollard reflected Robinson's theory in that the sermons communicated one central homiletical idea, reflected a connection with a text of Scripture interpreted according to Robinson's prescribed exegetical principles, and displayed a definite applicational intention. In addition, Pollard reflected Robinson's theory in the areas of sermon structure, prescribed style, and prescribed elements of introductions and conclusions.^ The study produced the following implications for preachers and homileticians. First, the presence of the central homiletical idea produces sermons that are more faithful to biblical revelation, informed by proper exegetical principles, and more rhetorically cohesive. Second, contemporary expository preaching should reflect a congruency with the literary genre of the text. The literary genre of the biblical text should inform the shape of the sermon. Third, stylistic elements such as an attention to transitions, a clear outline, short sentences, simple sentence structure, simple wording, vividness, and directness assist the expositor in communicating the biblical truth to a contemporary audience. Fourth, personal illustrations can be an effective tool in highlighting the central homiletical idea when tied closely to and subservient to the biblical text. ^ Fifth, the contemporary expositor should preach the whole counsel of God in his expository ministry in contrast to preaching an expository ""canon-within-a-canon."" An effective preaching plan gives attention to balancing the diversity of biblical genres. Sixth, expository theory is seen best as a philosophy rather than a morphological sermon form. Seventh, topical sermon structures possess inherent disadvantages and limitations for the contemporary expositor. Eighth, the contemporary expositor can employ extended quotations without losing the attention of a congregation if they are delivered from memory and movingly spoken from the heart. ^","Critical / Hermeneutical|Practitioner / Teacher Research ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Religion, Clergy|Theology|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Pollard, Franklin Dawes|Robinson, Haddon|Sermons|Expository preaching","Adviser","Preston Nix",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study of Paul's argumentation offers a fundamental contribution to both endeavours. Enthymemes, defined by the rhetorical tradition as the basic building blocks of deductive argumentation, constitute an important part of Paul's argumentation which until now has been relatively unexploited. Study of the manner in which Paul constructs enthymemes gives us insight into his thought world. The premisses that he uses as argumentative proofs can be viewed as a reflection of the common _Ê_social knowledge_Êù of the Pauline milieu. ^ The object of this inquiry is to study Paul's use of enthymemes as a rhetorical and argumentative tool and to evaluate what this reveals about his thought, his teaching, and his social world. The study begins with a discussion of the problem of enthymeme definition, followed by a clarification of criteria for identifying enthymemes in texts. A method of analysis is proposed. The entire corpus of Paul's seven undisputed letters is then _Ê_combed_Êù for enthymemes, one epistle at a time. Enthymemes are identified and analysed, and their argumentative premisses are catalogued thematically. This exercise permits a serious consideration of Paul's modes of argumentation, rhetorical aims and social world in the context of each epistle. Results from different epistles are compared as a means to consider, in general, Paul's rhetorical habits. ^ This thesis argues that enthymeme analysis is a necessary first step in Pauline exegesis. It is also argued that more attention needs to be given to enthymeme study in the research into Paul's social world. The question of how enthymeme study can inform the study of Paul's theology and core convictions is also discussed. ^","Rhetorical Analysis|Discourse or Text Analysis|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,2,"Religion, Biblical Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Letters|Argumentation|Saint|Enthymemes|Saint Paul","Adviser","I.

I define literacy development as an individual's development of writing competencies and appropriation of language and social practices in and around written texts within specific socio-cultural, interactional, and discursive contexts. I adopt a socio-cultural, hermeneutic approach to literacy and identity to propose an integrated model of academic biliteracy development and identity construction inspired by Bakhtin, Halliday, Riceur, Taylor, and Vygotsky. To understand how the participants engaged in academic literacy practices and constructed identities in their academic writing, I conducted 50 hours of autobiographical and text-based interviews about their writing, life plans and experiences, and sense of self as writers and learners, over three years. I also paid visits to the participants' homes and workplaces, and collected documents such as legal texts, university statutes, and national census data so as to situate the participants' texts and experiences within their autobiographical, institutional, historical, and societal contexts. Through selected excerpts from interviews, documents, and writing samples, I argue that the participants' academic biliteracy development and identity construction was shaped by their individual evaluative responses to social forces. I suggest the shared individual and collective responsibilities of scientists, language specialists, academic gate keepers, universities, and governments for the advancement of academic literacies in more than one language. I draw implications of this inquiry for academic biliteracy, instruction and research in bilingual academic writing, and the theoretization of writers' identities. ^","Clinical / Case Study|Model-Building ~check","",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Education, Bilingual and Multicultural|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Francophone|Academic biliteracy|Science writers|Identity construction","Adviser","Mary Maguire",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This dissertation looks beyond the historical and philological interests of these letters to discover what these rhetorical artifacts teach us about the rhetoricity of women's everyday household writings and the literate and social discourse practices of fifteenth-century gentlewomen. In doing so, this study examines the language of women's household letters to trace the rhetorical effects of women's letter-writing in maintaining the socioeconomic stability of family and household and in cultivating women's socio-political agency within their households and localities. ^ Using the social discourse theories of Mikhail Bakhtin, Pierre Bourdieu, and Norman Fairclough along with more recent discourse analysis and politeness theory as its theoretical framework, this study examines the linguistic effects of social relations on human utterances to show how relations of power shape women's discursive practices. To this end, my dissertation considers the intersubjectivity of women's letters to demonstrate how the routine social exchanges enacted in gentlewomen's letter-writing contribute to women's social agency and the formation of empowering social identities for women within their households and communities. ^ By way of introduction, chapter 1 examines the socioeconomic motives for women's letter-writing to bring into sharper focus the critical linkage between their letter-writing and their effective management of the household's internal and external economies. Chapter 2 examines women's role in epistolary production and how women could achieve a level of competency in epistolary discourse by relying on their own literate resources and through repeated exposure to the epistolary genre, its discourse conventions, and the participants (secretary, messenger, and recipient) involved in this literacy event. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 focus on how relations of power between gentlewomen and their male addressees are reflected, maintained, and subverted in the style and content of their letters. Chapter 3 examines how the language of women's letters both reflects women's subordinate accountancy to their husbands and helps women establish empowering subject positions for themselves. Chapter 4 demonstrates how women creatively expand their household letters by using their household narratives as a space of opportunity for self-promotion, self-fashioning, and, to a limited extent, self-publication. By examining a sample of petitionary letters men address to gentlewomen within these family archives, chapter 5 shows how the forms of address and rhetorical strategies men use to mitigate their requests contribute to a durable, textual image of these women as influential and forceful entities. ^","Rhetorical Analysis|Historical / Archival ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Biography|History, European|Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Fifteenth century|Household letters|Agnes Plumpton|Margaret Paston|England|Rhetoricity|Elizabeth Stonor|Isabel Plumpton|Gentlewomen","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the extent to which these debates have been translated into substantive policy change is much smaller than their frequency and intensity would suggest. Using matched case studies drawn from health reform initiatives in two countries, Canada and Germany, political discourse is demonstrated to be an important factor in the policy change process. Discourse, defined as the combination of policy ideas and the way in which they are framed within particular policy networks, can serve to reinforce a policy framework or to persuade various publics of the need for significant policy change, even in the absence of changes in institutions and interests. Two types of discourse, namely _ÊÑchallenging_Ê_ and _ÊÑtruth-seeking_Ê_, are hypothesized to be more conducive to significant policy change than are _ÊÑrhetorical_Ê_ or _ÊÑinstrumental_Ê_ discourses. Drawing on the case studies, the research shows that a _ÊÑchallenging_Ê_ discourse emerged in both countries, but led to significant policy change only in Germany. Based on the comparison of the two cases, it is argued that a number of factors are relevant for whether a challenging discourse is successful or not, including: degree of consensus on the gravity of the policy problem; the consistency of the discourse with broadly held normative values; and the persuasiveness of the _ÊÑsocial facts_Ê_ brought to bear in support of proposed new solutions. ^","Historical / Archival|Philosophical / Theoretical ~check|Model-Building ~check","",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Political Science, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Health Sciences, Health Care Management","Political discourse|Policy change|Germany|Canada|Health reform","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The expectation is that technology will facilitate the writing process by supporting cognitive processes and align school instruction with real-world tasks by providing more meaningful learning environments. This study tracked middle school students' task representation as they participated in protracted multimedia design and writing tasks. Students were engaged in the creation of a literary magazine over several weeks, with both written and media products linked to a particular theme. Cognitive strategies and behaviours associated with problem solving and communication are described through joint design activities. Students' working activities and their competencies in English Language Arts and Computer Science were identified, and cognitive processes tracked in negotiating and defining the boundaries of the task. Teachers' task representations were also examined in terms of their ability to address student variability; strengths and weaknesses between members of a group as well as their inherent dynamics are brought to the fore. Results point to the need for a better understanding of complex cognitive activities in developing new and more sophisticated repertoires of practice to realize the vision of children 'constructing' their own knowledge. Consequently, educators will gain new insights into what students can achieve when given the opportunities and the tools to do so. The role of educators is seen as instrumental in providing structure and mechanisms for supporting students' engagement in complex tasks. Findings underscore the importance of adopting a broader framework for thinking about the impact of students' participation in literacy projects. Limitations of the study are addressed as well as the key variables in the research on written composition and media literacy. This research also points to future directions for studies on complex cognitive activity by novice problem solvers and composers that include the potential uses that educators see in exploiting new pedagogical practices with technology within and beyond the walls of the classroom. ^","Ethnographic ~check|Discourse or Text Analysis","",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,2,"Education, Educational Psychology|Education, Secondary|Psychology, Cognitive|Language, Rhetoric and Composition|Education, Technology of","Task representation|Authors|Electronic texts|Multimedia|Writing|Middle school","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Taking as its central figure the swaggering midlife female trick skater and focusing in on dynamics characterising the public recreational ice skating scene at Montrê©al's <italic>Atrium le 1000</italic>, it draws on informal conversations conducted with skaters to create writing that skates, and develop an understanding of where communicating (through language) and skating (as and beyond writing) intersect. Adopting a visceral and sentient approach to researching, analysing and writing up the body, this thesis challenges the paradoxical absence of 'the corporeal' in the scholarly corpus, and embraces a researcher positioning which, while investigating the felt intensities of passion and pleasure, makes no apologies for its own excessiveness. Informed by poststructuralist thinking around affect and by feminist explorations of the gendered body, this thesis points to how the introduction of a truly 'alternative' sporting body into a 'disorganised' sporting environment can significantly impact how moments of self-actualisation as realised through participating in an activity like skating unfold, and how the communicatory relationships that come of joining the rink's communal flow materialise and evolve. In drawing attention to the liberatory potential opened up by this new conception of 'alternative,' this thesis raises our awareness both of the limitations inherent in those scholarly approaches that try to 'capture' moving bodies and motile activities within meaning and representation, and in those sporting and communicatory regimes that seek to 'pin down' aging female bodies. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical ~check|Ethnographic ~check","",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,"Women's Studies|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Writing|Women athletes|Affect|Skates|Midlife|Trick skater|Movement","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Conceptualizing three distinct aspects of narrative perspective-taking _Ê_ the representation of character perspective within the story, the representation of the communicative needs of an audience, and the representation of the narrative text as an autonomous product _Ê_ I collected four narrative samples from sixty-six 4- to 7-year olds. Each child retold two fables and dictated two original fictional stories to a scribe. To determine what cognitive factors might contribute to the development of narrative skill, children also completed two language tests (sentence repetition, receptive vocabulary), a working memory measure (backward digit span), and social-reasoning tasks, which included tests of understanding first- and second-order false belief as well as interpretive diversity. ^ The findings show significant development with age in all three areas of narrative perspective-taking, as the bulk of children's stories shifted from the depiction of simple action sequences at the age of 4 to multilayered tales integrating both character and audience perspective into complex plots by 6 or 7 years. Further, individual differences within age groups were as pronounced as developmental ones; a child's ability or inclination to represent perspective showed marked consistency across the four narrative samples. The three aspects of narrative perspective were highly intercorrelated; controlling for age, both the ability to accommodate an audience and children's text awareness were significantly related to the tendency to portray the inner worlds of story characters. ^ Correlational and regression analyses show social-reasoning ability to make a significant and independent contribution to all three aspects of narrative perspective-taking beyond the effects of age, working memory, and language. These results suggest that storytelling is more than simply a linguistic endeavour, and that children's stories may provide a window on their developing understanding of mind.

In essence, this dissertation expands on the emotional mode proposed by Michael A. Gilbert (1997), providing a more thorough understanding of what is entailed in emotional argumentation, as a means to enhancing its acknowledgment. The notion of argument subscribed to defines an argument as <italic>some sort of interaction where there is disagreement between parties. The disagreement can be quite innocuous, an aggressive and personally attacking episode, or anything in between these extremes. An emotional argument occurs when the dissent between interlocutors is of an emotional nature</italic>. ^ A detailed critical picture of Argumentation Theory, through the lens of feminism and post colonialism, is provided. These critiques demonstrate significant shortcomings of prominent argumentation theories, by pointing to criteria that get omitted from most models of argumentation analysis: culture, tradition, class, gender, age, sex, religion, among others, all of which tend to amalgamate with emotional arguments. The critique espoused argues that the tradition of argumentation can afford to be more inclusive of different modes of communicating dissent _Ê_ specifically so that emotional-type arguments have a place in the field.^ Selected theory behind emotions, arguments, and emotional arguments is provided, and five different types of emotional arguments are derived. In order to demonstrate the practicality of emotional arguments, they are then discussed alongside Walton's six dialogues (1998), demonstrating how they meet a particular dialogue's argumentative goals. ^ The ""Amenable Argumentation Approach"" is established as a broader framework that can accommodate more than just the traditional view of arguments. It encompasses traditional argumentation theories, plus it is open to adding new epistemological discoveries, observations, and practices that might remain outside the span of current argumentation theories. It is the conceptual framework and ideologies that sustain the Amenable Argumentation Approach that accommodate and acknowledge emotional arguments. ^ In conclusion, different tools stemming from Personality Theory, Conflict Resolution, and the practice of mediation are introduced as practical means for dealing with emotional arguments as theorists, analysts, lay people, professionals _Ê_ argument practitioners at large. ^","Philosophical / Theoretical|Model-Building|Critical / Hermeneutical ~check","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Philosophy|Psychology, General|Language, Rhetoric and Composition","Process-oriented|Argumentation|People-centered","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
