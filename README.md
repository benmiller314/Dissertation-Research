# Dissertation-Research
R code for analyzing dissertation metadata

This library contains both finalized and working drafts for my ongoing investigation into the content and methods of dissertations in Composition/Rhetoric. (Some of the older files also include abandoned lines of research; I hope to clean those up at some point when things are feeling more finished around here, and I'm sure I won't need to mine them for scraps.)

For an overview of most functional tools, see "re-run all analyses.R"; that file includes a number of comments and brief explanations of what you should expect to find, and where. It does not include an explanation of all helper functions, many of which have their own files, with explanatory comments inside.
